| **[FedIA: A Plug-and-Play Importance-Aware Gradient Pruning Aggregation Method for Domain-Robust Federated Graph Learning on Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18171v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) under domain skew -- as observed on platforms such as \emph{Twitch Gamers} and multilingual \emph{Wikipedia} networks -- drives client models toward incompatible representations, rendering naive aggregation both unstable and ineffective. We find that the culprit is not the weighting scheme but the \emph{noisy gradient signal}: empirical analysis of baseline methods suggests that a vast majority of gradient dimensions can be dominated by domain-specific variance. We therefore shift focus from "aggregation-first" to a \emph{projection-first} strategy that denoises client updates \emph{before} they are combined. The proposed FedIA framework realises this \underline{I}mportance-\underline{A}ware idea through a two-stage, plug-and-play pipeline: (i) a server-side top-$\rho$ mask keeps only the most informative about 5% of coordinates, and (ii) a lightweight influence-regularised momentum weight suppresses outlier clients. FedIA adds \emph{no extra uplink traffic and only negligible server memory}, making it readily deployable. On both homogeneous (Twitch Gamers) and heterogeneous (Wikipedia) graphs, it yields smoother, more stable convergence and higher final accuracy than nine strong baselines. A convergence sketch further shows that dynamic projection maintains the optimal $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{2}/\sqrt{T})$ rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Driven Federated Graph Learning on Model Heterogeneity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12624v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated graph learning (FGL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative graph representation learning, enabling multiple parties to jointly train models while preserving data privacy. However, most existing approaches assume homogeneous client models and largely overlook the challenge of model-centric heterogeneous FGL (MHtFGL), which frequently arises in practice when organizations employ graph neural networks (GNNs) of different scales and architectures.Such architectural diversity not only undermines smooth server-side aggregation, which presupposes a unified representation space shared across clients' updates, but also further complicates the transfer and integration of structural knowledge across clients. To address this issue, we propose the Federated Graph Knowledge Collaboration (FedGKC) framework. FedGKC introduces a lightweight Copilot Model on each client to facilitate knowledge exchange while local architectures are heterogeneous across clients, and employs two complementary mechanisms: Client-side Self-Mutual Knowledge Distillation, which transfers effective knowledge between local and copilot models through bidirectional distillation with multi-view perturbation; and Server-side Knowledge-Aware Model Aggregation, which dynamically assigns aggregation weights based on knowledge provided by clients. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedGKC achieves an average accuracy gain of 3.74% over baselines in MHtFGL scenarios, while maintaining excellent performance in homogeneous settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[EC-LDA : Label Distribution Inference Attack against Federated Graph Learning with Embedding Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15140v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for graph analysis. Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is an emerging learning framework to collaboratively train graph data from various clients. Although FGL allows client data to remain localized, a malicious server can still steal client private data information through uploaded gradient. In this paper, we for the first time propose label distribution attacks (LDAs) on FGL that aim to infer the label distributions of the client-side data. Firstly, we observe that the effectiveness of LDA is closely related to the variance of node embeddings in GNNs. Next, we analyze the relation between them and propose a new attack named EC-LDA, which significantly improves the attack effectiveness by compressing node embeddings. Then, extensive experiments on node classification and link prediction tasks across six widely used graph datasets show that EC-LDA outperforms the SOTA LDAs. Specifically, EC-LDA can achieve the Cos-sim as high as 1.0 under almost all cases. Finally, we explore the robustness of EC-LDA under differential privacy protection and discuss the potential effective defense methods to EC-LDA. Our code is available at https://github.com/cheng-t/EC-LDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by 2025 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Federated Hypergraph Learning with Local Differential Privacy: Toward Privacy-Aware Hypergraph Structure Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05160v3)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of graph-structured data necessitates partitioning and distributed storage across decentralized systems, driving the emergence of federated graph learning to collaboratively train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) without compromising privacy. However, current methods exhibit limited performance when handling hypergraphs, which inherently represent complex high-order relationships beyond pairwise connections. Partitioning hypergraph structures across federated subsystems amplifies structural complexity, hindering high-order information mining and compromising local information integrity. To bridge the gap between hypergraph learning and federated systems, we develop FedHGL, a first-of-its-kind framework for federated hypergraph learning on disjoint and privacy-constrained hypergraph partitions. Beyond collaboratively training a comprehensive hypergraph neural network across multiple clients, FedHGL introduces a pre-propagation hyperedge completion mechanism to preserve high-order structural integrity within each client. This procedure leverages the federated central server to perform cross-client hypergraph convolution without exposing internal topological information, effectively mitigating the high-order information loss induced by subgraph partitioning. Furthermore, by incorporating two kinds of local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms, we provide formal privacy guarantees for this process, ensuring that sensitive node features remain protected against inference attacks from potentially malicious servers or clients. Experimental results on seven real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate its performance advantages over traditional federated graph learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE International Conference on Data Mining 2025 (ICDM2025)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Communication-Efficient Decentralized Federated Graph Learning over Non-IID Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08409v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized Federated Graph Learning (DFGL) overcomes potential bottlenecks of the parameter server in FGL by establishing a peer-to-peer (P2P) communication network among workers. However, while extensive cross-worker communication of graph node embeddings is crucial for DFGL training, it introduces substantial communication costs. Most existing works typically construct sparse network topologies or utilize graph neighbor sampling methods to alleviate the communication overhead in DFGL. Intuitively, integrating these methods may offer promise for doubly improving communication efficiency in DFGL. However, our preliminary experiments indicate that directly combining these methods leads to significant training performance degradation if they are jointly optimized. To address this issue, we propose Duplex, a unified framework that jointly optimizes network topology and graph sampling by accounting for their coupled relationship, thereby significantly reducing communication cost while enhancing training performance in DFGL. To overcome practical DFGL challenges, eg, statistical heterogeneity and dynamic network environments, Duplex introduces a learning-driven algorithm to adaptively determine optimal network topologies and graph sampling ratios for workers. Experimental results demonstrate that Duplex reduces completion time by 20.1%--48.8% and communication costs by 16.7%--37.6% to achieve target accuracy, while improving accuracy by 3.3%--7.9% under identical resource budgets compared to baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedGraph: A Research Library and Benchmark for Federated Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06340v4)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated graph learning is an emerging field with significant practical challenges. While algorithms have been proposed to improve the accuracy of training graph neural networks, such as node classification on federated graphs, the system performance is often overlooked, despite it is crucial for real-world deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce FedGraph, a research library designed for practical distributed training and comprehensive benchmarking of FGL algorithms. FedGraph supports a range of state-of-the-art graph learning methods and includes a monitoring class that evaluates system performance, with a particular focus on communication and computation costs during training. Unlike existing federated learning platforms, FedGraph natively integrates homomorphic encryption to enhance privacy preservation and supports scalable deployment across multiple physical machines with system-level performance evaluation to guide the system design of future algorithms. To enhance efficiency and privacy, we propose a low-rank communication scheme for algorithms like FedGCN that require pre-training communication, accelerating both the pre-training and training phases. Extensive experiments benchmark FGL algorithms on three major graph learning tasks and demonstrate FedGraph as the first efficient FGL framework to support encrypted low-rank communication and scale to graphs with 100 million nodes.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/FedGraph/fedgraph</p></details> |
| **[S2FGL: Spatial Spectral Federated Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02409v4)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL from the structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label signals and a degradation in the semantic knowledge of the global GNN. From a spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drift occurs, undermining global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global knowledge repository to mitigate the challenge of poor semantic knowledge caused by label signal disruption. Furthermore, we design a frequency alignment to address spectral client drift. The combination of Spatial and Spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[DFed-SST: Building Semantic- and Structure-aware Topologies for Decentralized Federated Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11530v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has emerged as a robust distributed paradigm that circumvents the single-point-of-failure and communication bottleneck risks of centralized architectures. However, a significant challenge arises as existing DFL optimization strategies, primarily designed for tasks such as computer vision, fail to address the unique topological information inherent in the local subgraph. Notably, while Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is tailored for graph data, it is predominantly implemented in a centralized server-client model, failing to leverage the benefits of decentralization.To bridge this gap, we propose DFed-SST, a decentralized federated graph learning framework with adaptive communication. The core of our method is a dual-topology adaptive communication mechanism that leverages the unique topological features of each client's local subgraph to dynamically construct and optimize the inter-client communication topology. This allows our framework to guide model aggregation efficiently in the face of heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of DFed-SST, achieving 3.26% improvement in average accuracy over baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphFedMIG: Tackling Class Imbalance in Federated Graph Learning via Mutual Information-Guided Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10471v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private, decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information, hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators. By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value, minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Client-oriented Federated Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14188v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a new distributed graph learning paradigm, Federated Graph Learning (FGL) facilitates collaborative model training across local systems while preserving data privacy. We review existing FGL approaches and categorize their optimization mechanisms into: (1) Server-Client (S-C), where clients upload local model parameters for server-side aggregation and global updates; (2) Client-Client (C-C), which allows direct exchange of information between clients and customizing their local training process. We reveal that C-C shows superior potential due to its refined communication structure. However, existing C-C methods broadcast redundant node representations, incurring high communication costs and privacy risks at the node level. To this end, we propose FedC4, which combines graph Condensation with C-C Collaboration optimization. Specifically, FedC4 employs graph condensation technique to refine the knowledge of each client's graph into a few synthetic embeddings instead of transmitting node-level knowledge. Moreover, FedC4 introduces three novel modules that allow the source client to send distinct node representations tailored to the target client's graph properties. Experiments on eight public real-world datasets show that FedC4 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both task performance and communication cost. Our code is now available on https://github.com/Ereshkigal1/FedC4.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures; references added</p></details> |
| **[Personalized One-shot Federated Graph Learning for Heterogeneous Clients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11304v7)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for breaking data silos among distributed private graphs. In practical scenarios involving heterogeneous distributed graph data, personalized Federated Graph Learning (pFGL) aims to enhance model utility by training personalized models tailored to client needs. However, existing pFGL methods often require numerous communication rounds under heterogeneous graphs, leading to significant communication overhead and security concerns. While One-shot Federated Learning (OFL) enables collaboration in a single round, existing OFL methods are designed for image-centric tasks and are ineffective for graph data, leaving a critical gap in the field. Additionally, personalized models derived from existing methods suffer from bias, failing to effectively generalize to the minority. To address these challenges, we propose the first \textbf{O}ne-shot \textbf{p}ersonalized \textbf{F}ederated \textbf{G}raph \textbf{L}earning method (\textbf{O-pFGL}) for node classification, compatible with Secure Aggregation protocols for privacy preservation. Specifically, for effective graph learning in one communication round, our method estimates and aggregates class-wise feature distribution statistics to construct a global surrogate graph on the server, facilitating the training of a global graph model. To mitigate bias, we introduce a two-stage personalized training approach that adaptively balances local personal information and global insights from the surrogate graph, improving both personalization and generalization. Extensive experiments on 14 diverse real-world graph datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedSA-GCL: A Semi-Asynchronous Federated Graph Learning Framework with Personalized Aggregation and Cluster-Aware Broadcasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18219v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning (AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training. We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Graph Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02485v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The demand for data privacy has led to the development of frameworks like Federated Graph Learning (FGL), which facilitate decentralized model training. However, a significant operational challenge in such systems is adhering to the right to be forgotten. This principle necessitates robust mechanisms for two distinct types of data removal: the selective erasure of specific entities and their associated knowledge from local subgraphs and the wholesale removal of a user's entire dataset and influence. Existing methods often struggle to fully address both unlearning requirements, frequently resulting in incomplete data removal or the persistence of residual knowledge within the system. This work introduces a unified framework, conceived to provide a comprehensive solution to these challenges. The proposed framework employs a bifurcated strategy tailored to the specific unlearning request. For fine-grained Meta Unlearning, it uses prototype gradients to direct the initial local forgetting process, which is then refined by generating adversarial graphs to eliminate any remaining data traces among affected clients. In the case of complete client unlearning, the framework utilizes adversarial graph generation exclusively to purge the departed client's contributions from the remaining network. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets validate the proposed approach. The framework achieves substantial improvements in model prediction accuracy across both client and meta-unlearning scenarios when compared to existing methods. Furthermore, additional studies confirm its utility as a plug-in module, where it materially enhances the predictive capabilities and unlearning effectiveness of other established methods.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Who Owns This Sample: Cross-Client Membership Inference Attack in Federated Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19964v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-structured data is prevalent in many real-world applications, including social networks, financial systems, and molecular biology. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto standard for learning from such data due to their strong representation capabilities. As GNNs are increasingly deployed in federated learning (FL) settings to preserve data locality and privacy, new privacy threats arise from the interaction between graph structures and decentralized training. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of cross-client membership inference attacks (CC-MIA) against node classification tasks of federated GNNs (FedGNNs), where a malicious client aims to infer which client owns the given data. Unlike prior centralized-focused work that focuses on whether a sample was included in training, our attack targets sample-to-client attribution, a finer-grained privacy risk unique to federated settings. We design a general attack framework that exploits FedGNNs' aggregation behaviors, gradient updates, and embedding proximity to link samples to their source clients across training rounds. We evaluate our attack across multiple graph datasets under realistic FL setups. Results show that our method achieves high performance on both membership inference and ownership identification. Our findings highlight a new privacy threat in federated graph learning-client identity leakage through structural and model-level cues, motivating the need for attribution-robust GNN design.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Data-centric Overview of Federated Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16541v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of big data applications, Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has emerged as a prominent solution that reconcile the tradeoff between optimizing the collective intelligence between decentralized datasets holders and preserving sensitive information to maximum. Existing FGL surveys have contributed meaningfully but largely focus on integrating Federated Learning (FL) and Graph Machine Learning (GML), resulting in early stage taxonomies that emphasis on methodology and simulated scenarios. Notably, a data centric perspective, which systematically examines FGL methods through the lens of data properties and usage, remains unadapted to reorganize FGL research, yet it is critical to assess how FGL studies manage to tackle data centric constraints to enhance model performances. This survey propose a two-level data centric taxonomy: Data Characteristics, which categorizes studies based on the structural and distributional properties of datasets used in FGL, and Data Utilization, which analyzes the training procedures and techniques employed to overcome key data centric challenges. Each taxonomy level is defined by three orthogonal criteria, each representing a distinct data centric configuration. Beyond taxonomy, this survey examines FGL integration with Pretrained Large Models, showcases realistic applications, and highlights future direction aligned with emerging trends in GML.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Learning with Graph-Based Aggregation for Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09805v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In traffic prediction, the goal is to estimate traffic speed or flow in specific regions or road segments using historical data collected by devices deployed in each area. Each region or road segment can be viewed as an individual client that measures local traffic flow, making Federated Learning (FL) a suitable approach for collaboratively training models without sharing raw data. In centralized FL, a central server collects and aggregates model updates from multiple clients to build a shared model while preserving each client's data privacy. Standard FL methods, such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), assume that clients are independent, which can limit performance in traffic prediction tasks where spatial relationships between clients are important. Federated Graph Learning methods can capture these dependencies during server-side aggregation, but they often introduce significant computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight graph-aware FL approach that blends the simplicity of FedAvg with key ideas from graph learning. Rather than training full models, our method applies basic neighbourhood aggregation principles to guide parameter updates, weighting client models based on graph connectivity. This approach captures spatial relationships effectively while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate our method on two benchmark traffic datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, and show that it achieves competitive performance compared to standard baselines and recent graph-based federated learning techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FedKDD 2025: International Joint Workshop on Federated Learning for Data Mining and Graph Analytics. 6 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[FedHERO: A Federated Learning Approach for Node Classification Task on Heterophilic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21206v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) empowers clients to collaboratively train Graph neural networks (GNNs) in a distributed manner while preserving data privacy. However, FGL methods usually require that the graph data owned by all clients is homophilic to ensure similar neighbor distribution patterns of nodes. Such an assumption ensures that the learned knowledge is consistent across the local models from all clients. Therefore, these local models can be properly aggregated as a global model without undermining the overall performance. Nevertheless, when the neighbor distribution patterns of nodes vary across different clients (e.g., when clients hold graphs with different levels of heterophily), their local models may gain different and even conflict knowledge from their node-level predictive tasks. Consequently, aggregating these local models usually leads to catastrophic performance deterioration on the global model. To address this challenge, we propose FedHERO, an FGL framework designed to harness and share insights from heterophilic graphs effectively. At the heart of FedHERO is a dual-channel GNN equipped with a structure learner, engineered to discern the structural knowledge encoded in the local graphs. With this specialized component, FedHERO enables the local model for each client to identify and learn patterns that are universally applicable across graphs with different patterns of node neighbor distributions. FedHERO not only enhances the performance of individual client models by leveraging both local and shared structural insights but also sets a new precedent in this field to effectively handle graph data with various node neighbor distribution patterns. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the superior performance of FedHERO against existing alternatives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Effective Federated Graph Foundation Model via Mitigating Knowledge Entanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12684v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in graph machine learning have shifted to data-centric paradigms, driven by two emerging fields: (1) Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multi-client collaboration but faces challenges from data and task heterogeneity, limiting its practicality; (2) Graph foundation models (GFM) offer strong domain generalization but are usually trained on single machines, missing out on cross-silo data and resources. These paradigms are complementary, and their integration brings notable benefits. Motivated by this, we propose FedGFM, a novel decentralized GFM training paradigm. However, a key challenge is knowledge entanglement, where multi-domain knowledge merges into indistinguishable representations, hindering downstream adaptation. To address this, we present FedGFM+, an enhanced framework with two core modules to reduce knowledge entanglement: (1) AncDAI: A global anchor-based domain-aware initialization strategy. Before pre-training, each client encodes its local graph into domain-specific prototypes that serve as semantic anchors. Synthetic embeddings around these anchors initialize the global model. We theoretically prove these prototypes are distinguishable across domains, providing a strong inductive bias to disentangle domain-specific knowledge. (2) AdaDPP: A local adaptive domain-sensitive prompt pool. Each client learns a lightweight graph prompt capturing domain semantics during pre-training. During fine-tuning, prompts from all clients form a pool from which the GFM selects relevant prompts to augment target graph attributes, improving downstream adaptation. FedGFM+ is evaluated on 8 diverse benchmarks across multiple domains and tasks, outperforming 20 baselines from supervised learning, FGL, and federated GFM variants.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[FedGRec: Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Federated Graph Learning for Secure and Efficient Cross-Border Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18177v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the highly sensitive nature of certain data in cross-border sharing, collaborative cross-border recommendations and data sharing are often subject to stringent privacy protection regulations, resulting in insufficient data for model training. Consequently, achieving efficient cross-border business recommendations while ensuring privacy security poses a significant challenge. Although federated learning has demonstrated broad potential in collaborative training without exposing raw data, most existing federated learning-based GNN training methods still rely on federated averaging strategies, which perform suboptimally on highly heterogeneous graph data. To address this issue, we propose FedGRec, a privacy-preserving federated graph learning method for cross-border recommendations. FedGRec captures user preferences from distributed multi-domain data to enhance recommendation performance across all domains without privacy leakage. Specifically, FedGRec leverages collaborative signals from local subgraphs associated with users or items to enrich their representation learning. Additionally, it employs dynamic spatiotemporal modeling to integrate global and local user preferences in real time based on business recommendation states, thereby deriving the final representations of target users and candidate items. By automatically filtering relevant behaviors, FedGRec effectively mitigates noise interference from unreliable neighbors. Furthermore, through a personalized federated aggregation strategy, FedGRec adapts global preferences to heterogeneous domain data, enabling collaborative learning of user preferences across multiple domains. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that FedGRec consistently outperforms competitive single-domain and cross-domain baselines while effectively preserving data privacy in cross-border recommendations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Federated Graph Learning: A Data Condensation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02573v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated graph learning is a widely recognized technique that promotes collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) by multi-client graphs.However, existing approaches heavily rely on the communication of model parameters or gradients for federated optimization and fail to adequately address the data heterogeneity introduced by intricate and diverse graph distributions. Although some methods attempt to share additional messages among the server and clients to improve federated convergence during communication, they introduce significant privacy risks and increase communication overhead. To address these issues, we introduce the concept of a condensed graph as a novel optimization carrier to address FGL data heterogeneity and propose a new FGL paradigm called FedGM. Specifically, we utilize a generalized condensation graph consensus to aggregate comprehensive knowledge from distributed graphs, while minimizing communication costs and privacy risks through a single transmission of the condensed data. Extensive experiments on six public datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FedGM over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting its potential for a novel FGL paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fairness in Graph Learning Augmented with Machine Learning: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21296v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmenting specialised machine learning techniques into traditional graph learning models has achieved notable success across various domains, including federated graph learning, dynamic graph learning, and graph transformers. However, the intricate mechanisms of these specialised techniques introduce significant challenges in maintaining model fairness, potentially resulting in discriminatory outcomes in high-stakes applications such as recommendation systems, disaster response, criminal justice, and loan approval. This paper systematically examines the unique fairness challenges posed by Graph Learning augmented with Machine Learning (GL-ML). It highlights the complex interplay between graph learning mechanisms and machine learning techniques, emphasising how the augmentation of machine learning both enhances and complicates fairness. Additionally, we explore four critical techniques frequently employed to improve fairness in GL-ML methods. By thoroughly investigating the root causes and broader implications of fairness challenges in this rapidly evolving field, this work establishes a robust foundation for future research and innovation in GL-ML fairness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unbiased Federated Graph Learning: Label and Topology Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09963v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) enables privacy-preserving, distributed training of graph neural networks without sharing raw data. Among its approaches, subgraph-FL has become the dominant paradigm, with most work focused on improving overall node classification accuracy. However, these methods often overlook fairness due to the complexity of node features, labels, and graph structures. In particular, they perform poorly on nodes with disadvantaged properties, such as being in the minority class within subgraphs or having heterophilous connections (neighbors with dissimilar labels or misleading features). This reveals a critical issue: high accuracy can mask degraded performance on structurally or semantically marginalized nodes. To address this, we advocate for two fairness goals: (1) improving representation of minority class nodes for class-wise fairness and (2) mitigating topological bias from heterophilous connections for topology-aware fairness. We propose FairFGL, a novel framework that enhances fairness through fine-grained graph mining and collaborative learning. On the client side, the History-Preserving Module prevents overfitting to dominant local classes, while the Majority Alignment Module refines representations of heterophilous majority-class nodes. The Gradient Modification Module transfers minority-class knowledge from structurally favorable clients to improve fairness. On the server side, FairFGL uploads only the most influenced subset of parameters to reduce communication costs and better reflect local distributions. A cluster-based aggregation strategy reconciles conflicting updates and curbs global majority dominance . Extensive evaluations on eight benchmarks show FairFGL significantly improves minority-group performance , achieving up to a 22.62 percent Macro-F1 gain while enhancing convergence over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Federated Prototype Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09493v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has gained significant attention for its distributed training capabilities in graph-based machine intelligence applications, mitigating data silos while offering a new perspective for privacy-preserve large-scale graph learning. However, multi-level FGL heterogeneity presents various client-server collaboration challenges: (1) Model-level: The variation in clients for expected performance and scalability necessitates the deployment of heterogeneous models. Unfortunately, most FGL methods rigidly demand identical client models due to the direct model weight aggregation on the server. (2) Data-level: The intricate nature of graphs, marked by the entanglement of node profiles and topology, poses an optimization dilemma. This implies that models obtained by federated training struggle to achieve superior performance. (3) Communication-level: Some FGL methods attempt to increase message sharing among clients or between clients and the server to improve training, which inevitably leads to high communication costs. In this paper, we propose FedPG as a general prototype-guided optimization method for the above multi-level FGL heterogeneity. Specifically, on the client side, we integrate multi-level topology-aware prototypes to capture local graph semantics. Subsequently, on the server side, leveraging the uploaded prototypes, we employ topology-guided contrastive learning and personalized technology to tailor global prototypes for each client, broadcasting them to improve local training. Experiments demonstrate that FedPG outperforms SOTA baselines by an average of 3.57\% in accuracy while reducing communication costs by 168x.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Data-centric Federated Graph Learning with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19455v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In federated graph learning (FGL), a complete graph is divided into multiple subgraphs stored in each client due to privacy concerns, and all clients jointly train a global graph model by only transmitting model parameters. A pain point of FGL is the heterogeneity problem, where nodes or structures present non-IID properties among clients (e.g., different node label distributions), dramatically undermining the convergence and performance of FGL. To address this, existing efforts focus on design strategies at the model level, i.e., they design models to extract common knowledge to mitigate heterogeneity. However, these model-level strategies fail to fundamentally address the heterogeneity problem as the model needs to be designed from scratch when transferring to other tasks. Motivated by large language models (LLMs) having achieved remarkable success, we aim to utilize LLMs to fully understand and augment local text-attributed graphs, to address data heterogeneity at the data level. In this paper, we propose a general framework LLM4FGL that innovatively decomposes the task of LLM for FGL into two sub-tasks theoretically. Specifically, for each client, it first utilizes the LLM to generate missing neighbors and then infers connections between generated nodes and raw nodes. To improve the quality of generated nodes, we design a novel federated generation-and-reflection mechanism for LLMs, without the need to modify the parameters of the LLM but relying solely on the collective feedback from all clients. After neighbor generation, all the clients utilize a pre-trained edge predictor to infer the missing edges. Furthermore, our framework can seamlessly integrate as a plug-in with existing FGL methods. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to advanced baselines.</p></details> | ongoing work |
| **[Virtual Nodes Can Help: Tackling Distribution Shifts in Federated Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19229v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to jointly train powerful graph learning models, e.g., Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), without sharing their local graph data for graph-related downstream tasks, such as graph property prediction. In the real world, however, the graph data can suffer from significant distribution shifts across clients as the clients may collect their graph data for different purposes. In particular, graph properties are usually associated with invariant label-relevant substructures (i.e., subgraphs) across clients, while label-irrelevant substructures can appear in a client-specific manner. The issue of distribution shifts of graph data hinders the efficiency of GNN training and leads to serious performance degradation in FGL. To tackle the aforementioned issue, we propose a novel FGL framework entitled FedVN that eliminates distribution shifts through client-specific graph augmentation strategies with multiple learnable Virtual Nodes (VNs). Specifically, FedVN lets the clients jointly learn a set of shared VNs while training a global GNN model. To eliminate distribution shifts, each client trains a personalized edge generator that determines how the VNs connect local graphs in a client-specific manner. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analyses indicating that FedVN can eliminate distribution shifts of graph data across clients. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets under five settings demonstrate the superiority of our proposed FedVN over nine baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

This approach inherently involves large-scale distributed graph processing, which closely aligns with the challenges and research focuses of graph-based data systems. Despite the proliferation of FGL, the diverse motivations from real-world applications, spanning various research backgrounds and settings, pose a significant challenge to fair evaluation. To fill this gap, we propose OpenFGL, a unified benchmark designed for the primary FGL scenarios: Graph-FL and Subgraph-FL. Specifically, OpenFGL includes 42 graph datasets from 18 application domains, 8 federated data simulation strategies that emphasize different graph properties, and 5 graph-based downstream tasks. Additionally, it offers 18 recently proposed SOTA FGL algorithms through a user-friendly API, enabling a thorough comparison and comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. Our empirical results demonstrate the capabilities of FGL while also highlighting its potential limitations, providing valuable insights for future research in this growing field, particularly in fostering greater interdisciplinary collaboration between FGL and data systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Federated Graph Learning via Adaptive Fusion of Structural and Node Characteristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18845v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has demonstrated the advantage of training a global Graph Neural Network (GNN) model across distributed clients using their local graph data. Unlike Euclidean data (\eg, images), graph data is composed of nodes and edges, where the overall node-edge connections determine the topological structure, and individual nodes along with their neighbors capture local node features. However, existing studies tend to prioritize one aspect over the other, leading to an incomplete understanding of the data and the potential misidentification of key characteristics across varying graph scenarios. Additionally, the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) nature of graph data makes the extraction of these two data characteristics even more challenging. To address the above issues, we propose a novel FGL framework, named FedGCF, which aims to simultaneously extract and fuse structural properties and node features to effectively handle diverse graph scenarios. FedGCF first clusters clients by structural similarity, performing model aggregation within each cluster to form the shared structural model. Next, FedGCF selects the clients with common node features and aggregates their models to generate a common node model. This model is then propagated to all clients, allowing common node features to be shared. By combining these two models with a proper ratio, FedGCF can achieve a comprehensive understanding of the graph data and deliver better performance, even under non-IID distributions. Experimental results show that FedGCF improves accuracy by 4.94%-7.24% under different data distributions and reduces communication cost by 64.18%-81.25% to reach the same accuracy compared to baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedGIG: Graph Inversion from Gradient in Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18513v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIA), which can recover private training data from shared gradients. However, existing methods are designed for dense, continuous data such as images or vectorized texts, and cannot be directly applied to sparse and discrete graph data. This paper first explores GIA's impact on Federated Graph Learning (FGL) and introduces Graph Inversion from Gradient in Federated Learning (FedGIG), a novel GIA method specifically designed for graph-structured data. FedGIG includes the adjacency matrix constraining module, which ensures the sparsity and discreteness of the reconstructed graph data, and the subgraph reconstruction module, which is designed to complete missing common subgraph structures. Extensive experiments on molecular datasets demonstrate FedGIG's superior accuracy over existing GIA techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Graph Condensation with Information Bottleneck Principles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03911v4)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph condensation (GC), which reduces the size of a large-scale graph by synthesizing a small-scale condensed graph as its substitution, has benefited various graph learning tasks. However, existing GC methods rely on centralized data storage, which is unfeasible for real-world decentralized data distribution, and overlook data holders' privacy-preserving requirements. To bridge this gap, we propose and study the novel problem of federated graph condensation (FGC) for graph neural networks (GNNs). Specifically, we first propose a general framework for FGC, where we decouple the typical gradient matching process for GC into client-side gradient calculation and server-side gradient matching, integrating knowledge from multiple clients' subgraphs into one smaller condensed graph. Nevertheless, our empirical studies show that under the federated setting, the condensed graph will consistently leak data membership privacy, i.e., the condensed graph during federated training can be utilized to steal training data under the membership inference attack (MIA). To tackle this issue, we innovatively incorporate information bottleneck principles into the FGC, which only needs to extract partial node features in one local pre-training step and utilize the features during federated training. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that our framework consistently protects membership privacy during training. Meanwhile, it can achieve comparable and even superior performance against existing centralized GC and federated graph learning (FGL) methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages.

| **[Communication-Efficient Personalized Federal Graph Learning via Low-Rank Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13442v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated graph learning (FGL) has gained significant attention for enabling heterogeneous clients to process their private graph data locally while interacting with a centralized server, thus maintaining privacy. However, graph data on clients are typically non-IID, posing a challenge for a single model to perform well across all clients. Another major bottleneck of FGL is the high cost of communication. To address these challenges, we propose a communication-efficient personalized federated graph learning algorithm, CEFGL. Our method decomposes the model parameters into low-rank generic and sparse private models. We employ a dual-channel encoder to learn sparse local knowledge in a personalized manner and low-rank global knowledge in a shared manner. Additionally, we perform multiple local stochastic gradient descent iterations between communication phases and integrate efficient compression techniques into the algorithm. The advantage of CEFGL lies in its ability to capture common and individual knowledge more precisely. By utilizing low-rank and sparse parameters along with compression techniques, CEFGL significantly reduces communication complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves optimal classification accuracy in a variety of heterogeneous environments across sixteen datasets. Specifically, compared to the state-of-the-art method FedStar, the proposed method (with GIN as the base model) improves accuracy by 5.64\% on cross-datasets setting CHEM, reduces communication bits by a factor of 18.58, and reduces the communication time by a factor of 1.65.</p></details> |  |

However, label noise can degrade the global model's generalization performance. Existing federated label noise learning methods, primarily focused on computer vision, often yield suboptimal results when applied to FGL. To address this, we propose a robust federated graph learning method with label noise, termed FedRGL. FedRGL introduces dual-perspective consistency noise node filtering, leveraging both the global model and subgraph structure under class-aware dynamic thresholds. To enhance client-side training, we incorporate graph contrastive learning, which improves encoder robustness and assigns high-confidence pseudo-labels to noisy nodes. Additionally, we measure model quality via predictive entropy of unlabeled nodes, enabling adaptive robust aggregation of the global model. Comparative experiments on multiple real-world graph datasets show that FedRGL outperforms 12 baseline methods across various noise rates, types, and numbers of clients.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods usually assume that each client has both node features and graph structure of its graph data. In real-world scenarios, however, there exist federated systems where only a part of the clients have such data while other clients (i.e. graphless clients) may only have node features. This naturally leads to a novel problem in FGL: how to jointly train a model over distributed graph data with graphless clients? In this paper, we propose a novel framework FedGLS to tackle the problem in FGL with graphless clients. In FedGLS, we devise a local graph learner on each graphless client which learns the local graph structure with the structure knowledge transferred from other clients. To enable structure knowledge transfer, we design a GNN model and a feature encoder on each client. During local training, the feature encoder retains the local graph structure knowledge together with the GNN model via knowledge distillation, and the structure knowledge is transferred among clients in global update. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed FedGLS over five baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |

However, the distributed data silos limit the performance of GNN. Vertical federated learning (VFL), an emerging technique to process distributed data, successfully makes GNN possible to handle the distributed graph-structured data. Despite the prosperous development of vertical federated graph learning (VFGL), the robustness of VFGL against the adversarial attack has not been explored yet. Although numerous adversarial attacks against centralized GNNs are proposed, their attack performance is challenged in the VFGL scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore the adversarial attack against VFGL. A query-efficient hybrid adversarial attack framework is proposed to significantly improve the centralized adversarial attacks against VFGL, denoted as NA2, short for Neuron-based Adversarial Attack. Specifically, a malicious client manipulates its local training data to improve its contribution in a stealthy fashion. Then a shadow model is established based on the manipulated data to simulate the behavior of the server model in VFGL. As a result, the shadow model can improve the attack success rate of various centralized attacks with a few queries. Extensive experiments on five real-world benchmarks demonstrate that NA2 improves the performance of the centralized adversarial attacks against VFGL, achieving state-of-the-art performance even under potential adaptive defense where the defender knows the attack method. Additionally, we provide interpretable experiments of the effectiveness of NA2 via sensitive neurons identification and visualization of t-SNE.</p></details> |  |

A critical challenge in FGL is to enable effective yet efficient federated optimization against multifaceted graph heterogeneity to enhance mutual performance. However, existing FGL works primarily address graph data heterogeneity and perform incapable of graph task heterogeneity. To address the challenge, we propose a Federated Graph Prompt Learning (FedGPL) framework to efficiently enable prompt-based asymmetric graph knowledge transfer between multifaceted heterogeneous federated participants. Generally, we establish a split federated framework to preserve universal and domain-specific graph knowledge, respectively. Moreover, we develop two algorithms to eliminate task and data heterogeneity for advanced federated knowledge preservation. First, a Hierarchical Directed Transfer Aggregator (HiDTA) delivers cross-task beneficial knowledge that is hierarchically distilled according to the directional transferability. Second, a Virtual Prompt Graph (VPG) adaptively generates graph structures to enhance data utility by distinguishing dominant subgraphs and neutralizing redundant ones. We conduct theoretical analyses and extensive experiments to demonstrate the significant accuracy and efficiency effectiveness of FedGPL against multifaceted graph heterogeneity compared to state-of-the-art baselines on large-scale federated graph datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, many recent CDR models overlook crucial issues such as privacy as well as the risk of negative transfer (which negatively impact model performance), especially in multi-domain settings. To address these challenges, we propose FedGCDR, a novel federated graph learning framework that securely and effectively leverages positive knowledge from multiple source domains. First, we design a positive knowledge transfer module that ensures privacy during inter-domain knowledge transmission. This module employs differential privacy-based knowledge extraction combined with a feature mapping mechanism, transforming source domain embeddings from federated graph attention networks into reliable domain knowledge. Second, we design a knowledge activation module to filter out potential harmful or conflicting knowledge from source domains, addressing the issues of negative transfer. This module enhances target domain training by expanding the graph of the target domain to generate reliable domain attentions and fine-tunes the target model for improved negative knowledge filtering and more accurate predictions. We conduct extensive experiments on 16 popular domains of the Amazon dataset, demonstrating that FedGCDR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS'24</p></details> |

In cross-domain scenarios, structural heterogeneity poses significant challenges for pFGL. Nevertheless, previous pFGL methods incorrectly share non-generic knowledge globally and fail to tailor personalized solutions locally under domain structural shift. We innovatively reveal that the spectral nature of graphs can well reflect inherent domain structural shifts. Correspondingly, our method overcomes it by sharing generic spectral knowledge. Moreover, we indicate the biased message-passing schemes for graph structures and propose the personalized preference module. Combining both strategies, we propose our pFGL framework FedSSP which Shares generic Spectral knowledge while satisfying graph Preferences. Furthermore, We perform extensive experiments on cross-dataset and cross-domain settings to demonstrate the superiority of our framework.

However, during the development and deployment of FedGL models, they are susceptible to illegal copying and model theft. Backdoor-based watermarking is a well-known method for mitigating these attacks, as it offers ownership verification to the model owner. We take the first step to protect the ownership of FedGL models via backdoor-based watermarking. Existing techniques have challenges in achieving the goal: 1) they either cannot be directly applied or yield unsatisfactory performance; 2) they are vulnerable to watermark removal attacks; and 3) they lack of formal guarantees. To address all the challenges, we propose FedGMark, the first certified robust backdoor-based watermarking for FedGL. FedGMark leverages the unique graph structure and client information in FedGL to learn customized and diverse watermarks. It also designs a novel GL architecture that facilitates defending against both the empirical and theoretically worst-case watermark removal attacks. Extensive experiments validate the promising empirical and provable watermarking performance of FedGMark.

As graph datasets grow, managing large, decentralized subgraphs becomes essential, particularly within federated learning frameworks. These frameworks face significant challenges, including missing neighbor information, which can compromise model reliability in safety-critical settings. Deployment of federated learning models trained in such settings necessitates quantifying the uncertainty of the models. This study extends the applicability of Conformal Prediction (CP), a well-established method for uncertainty quantification, to federated graph learning. We specifically tackle the missing links issue in distributed subgraphs to minimize its adverse effects on CP set sizes. We discuss data dependencies across the distributed subgraphs and establish conditions for CP validity and precise test-time coverage. We introduce a Variational Autoencoder-based approach for reconstructing missing neighbors to mitigate the negative impact of missing data. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, yielding smaller prediction sets while ensuring coverage guarantees.</p></details> |  |

With accurate and timely forecasts, employers can adapt their recruitment strategies to align with the evolving labor market, and employees can have proactive career path planning according to future demand and supply. However, previous studies ignore the interconnection between demand-supply sequences among different companies and positions for predicting variations. Moreover, companies are reluctant to share their private human resource data for global labor market analysis due to concerns over jeopardizing competitive advantage, security threats, and potential ethical or legal violations. To this end, in this paper, we formulate the Federated Labor Market Forecasting (FedLMF) problem and propose a Meta-personalized Convergence-aware Clustered Federated Learning (MPCAC-FL) framework to provide accurate and timely collaborative talent demand and supply prediction in a privacy-preserving way. First, we design a graph-based sequential model to capture the inherent correlation between demand and supply sequences and company-position pairs. Second, we adopt meta-learning techniques to learn effective initial model parameters that can be shared across companies, allowing personalized models to be optimized for forecasting company-specific demand and supply, even when companies have heterogeneous data. Third, we devise a Convergence-aware Clustering algorithm to dynamically divide companies into groups according to model similarity and apply federated aggregation in each group. The heterogeneity can be alleviated for more stable convergence and better performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPCAC-FL outperforms compared baselines on three real-world datasets and achieves over 97% of the state-of-the-art model, i.e., DH-GEM, without exposing private company data.</p></details> |  |

Federated learning emerges as a solution, enabling collaborative model training without users directly sharing their raw data. However, integrating federated learning with GNNs presents unique challenges, especially when a client represents a graph node and holds merely a single feature vector. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for node-level federated graph learning. Specifically, we decouple the message-passing and feature vector transformation processes of the first GNN layer, allowing them to be executed separately on the user devices and the cloud server. Moreover, we introduce a graph Laplacian term based on the feature vector's latent representation to regulate the user-side model updates. The experiment results on multiple datasets show that our approach achieves better performance compared with baselines.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

A key challenge for FedGCN is scaling to large-scale graphs, which typically incurs high computation and communication costs when dealing with the explosively increasing number of neighbors. Existing graph sampling-enhanced FedGCN training approaches ignore graph structural information or dynamics of optimization, resulting in high variance and inaccurate node embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose the Federated Adaptive Importance-based Sampling (FedAIS) approach. It achieves substantial computational cost saving by focusing the limited resources on training important nodes, while reducing communication overhead via adaptive historical embedding synchronization. The proposed adaptive importance-based sampling method jointly considers the graph structural heterogeneity and the optimization dynamics to achieve optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Extensive evaluations against five state-of-the-art baselines on five real-world graph datasets show that FedAIS achieves comparable or up to 3.23% higher test accuracy, while saving communication and computation costs by 91.77% and 85.59%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tackling the Local Bias in Federated Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12906v3)** | 2024-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated graph learning (FGL) has become an important research topic in response to the increasing scale and the distributed nature of graph-structured data in the real world. In FGL, a global graph is distributed across different clients, where each client holds a subgraph. Existing FGL methods often fail to effectively utilize cross-client edges, losing structural information during the training; additionally, local graphs often exhibit significant distribution divergence. These two issues make local models in FGL less desirable than in centralized graph learning, namely the local bias problem in this paper. To solve this problem, we propose a novel FGL framework to make the local models similar to the model trained in a centralized setting. Specifically, we design a distributed learning scheme, fully leveraging cross-client edges to aggregate information from other clients. In addition, we propose a label-guided sampling approach to alleviate the imbalanced local data and meanwhile, distinctly reduce the training overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that local bias can compromise the model performance and slow down the convergence during training. Experimental results also verify that our framework successfully mitigates local bias, achieving better performance than other baselines with lower time and memory overhead.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

Nevertheless, FGL still faces the challenge of the severe non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) nature of graphs, which possess diverse node and edge structures, especially across varied domains. Thus, exploring the knowledge inherent in these structures becomes significantly crucial. Existing methods, however, either overlook the inherent structural knowledge in graph data or capture it at the cost of significantly increased resource demands (e.g., FLOPs and communication bandwidth), which can be detrimental to distributed paradigms. Inspired by this, we propose FedDense, a novel FGL framework that optimizes the utilization efficiency of inherent structural knowledge. To better acquire knowledge of diverse and underexploited structures, FedDense first explicitly encodes the structural knowledge inherent within graph data itself alongside node features. Besides, FedDense introduces a Dual-Densely Connected (DDC) GNN architecture that exploits the multi-scale (i.e., one-hop to multi-hop) feature and structure insights embedded in the aggregated feature maps at each layer. In addition to the exploitation of inherent structures, we consider resource limitations in FGL, devising exceedingly narrow layers atop the DDC architecture and adopting a selective parameter sharing strategy to reduce resource costs substantially. We conduct extensive experiments using 15 datasets across 4 different domains, demonstrating that FedDense consistently surpasses baselines by a large margin in training performance, while demanding minimal resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Graph Learning with Structure Proxy Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09393v1)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) aims to learn graph learning models over graph data distributed in multiple data owners, which has been applied in various applications such as social recommendation and financial fraud detection. Inherited from generic Federated Learning (FL), FGL similarly has the data heterogeneity issue where the label distribution may vary significantly for distributed graph data across clients. For instance, a client can have the majority of nodes from a class, while another client may have only a few nodes from the same class. This issue results in divergent local objectives and impairs FGL convergence for node-level tasks, especially for node classification. Moreover, FGL also encounters a unique challenge for the node classification task: the nodes from a minority class in a client are more likely to have biased neighboring information, which prevents FGL from learning expressive node embeddings with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To grapple with the challenge, we propose FedSpray, a novel FGL framework that learns local class-wise structure proxies in the latent space and aligns them to obtain global structure proxies in the server. Our goal is to obtain the aligned structure proxies that can serve as reliable, unbiased neighboring information for node classification. To achieve this, FedSpray trains a global feature-structure encoder and generates unbiased soft targets with structure proxies to regularize local training of GNN models in a personalized way. We conduct extensive experiments over four datasets, and experiment results validate the superiority of FedSpray compared with other baselines.

However, most existing FGL studies do not well consider the missing inter-client topology information in real-world scenarios, causing insufficient feature aggregation of multi-hop neighbor clients during model training. Moreover, the classic FGL commonly adopts the FedAvg but neglects the high training costs when the number of clients expands, resulting in the overload of a single edge server. To address these important challenges, we propose a novel FGL framework, named SpreadFGL, to promote the information flow in edge-client collaboration and extract more generalized potential relationships between clients. In SpreadFGL, an adaptive graph imputation generator incorporated with a versatile assessor is first designed to exploit the potential links between subgraphs, without sharing raw data. Next, a new negative sampling mechanism is developed to make SpreadFGL concentrate on more refined information in downstream tasks. To facilitate load balancing at the edge layer, SpreadFGL follows a distributed training manner that enables fast model convergence. Using real-world testbed and benchmark graph datasets, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SpreadFGL. The results show that SpreadFGL achieves higher accuracy and faster convergence against state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> |  |

FL for non-graph data has shown to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which inject a shared backdoor trigger into the training data such that the trained backdoored FL model can predict the testing data containing the trigger as the attacker desires. However, FedGL against backdoor attacks is largely unexplored, and no effective defense exists. In this paper, we aim to address such significant deficiency. First, we propose an effective, stealthy, and persistent backdoor attack on FedGL. Our attack uses a subgraph as the trigger and designs an adaptive trigger generator that can derive the effective trigger location and shape for each graph. Our attack shows that empirical defenses are hard to detect/remove our generated triggers. To mitigate it, we further develop a certified defense for any backdoored FedGL model against the trigger with any shape at any location. Our defense involves carefully dividing a testing graph into multiple subgraphs and designing a majority vote-based ensemble classifier on these subgraphs. We then derive the deterministic certified robustness based on the ensemble classifier and prove its tightness. We extensively evaluate our attack and defense on six graph datasets. Our attack results show our attack can obtain > 90% backdoor accuracy in almost all datasets. Our defense results show, in certain cases, the certified accuracy for clean testing graphs against an arbitrary trigger with size 20 can be close to the normal accuracy under no attack, while there is a moderate gap in other cases. Moreover, the certified backdoor accuracy is always 0 for backdoored testing graphs generated by our attack, implying our defense can fully mitigate the attack.

| **[Federated Graph Semantic and Structural Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18937v2)** | 2024-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated graph learning collaboratively learns a global graph neural network with distributed graphs, where the non-independent and identically distributed property is one of the major challenges. Most relative arts focus on traditional distributed tasks like images and voices, incapable of graph structures. This paper firstly reveals that local client distortion is brought by both node-level semantics and graph-level structure. First, for node-level semantics, we find that contrasting nodes from distinct classes is beneficial to provide a well-performing discrimination. We pull the local node towards the global node of the same class and push it away from the global node of different classes. Second, we postulate that a well-structural graph neural network possesses similarity for neighbors due to the inherent adjacency relationships. However, aligning each node with adjacent nodes hinders discrimination due to the potential class inconsistency. We transform the adjacency relationships into the similarity distribution and leverage the global model to distill the relation knowledge into the local model, which preserves the structural information and discriminability of the local model. Empirical results on three graph datasets manifest the superiority of the proposed method over its counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiFGL: A Hierarchical Framework for Cross-silo Cross-device Federated Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10616v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has emerged as a promising way to learn high-quality representations from distributed graph data with privacy preservation. Despite considerable efforts have been made for FGL under either cross-device or cross-silo paradigm, how to effectively capture graph knowledge in a more complicated cross-silo cross-device environment remains an under-explored problem. However, this task is challenging because of the inherent hierarchy and heterogeneity of decentralized clients, diversified privacy constraints in different clients, and the cross-client graph integrity requirement. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Federated Graph Learning (HiFGL) framework for cross-silo cross-device FGL. Specifically, we devise a unified hierarchical architecture to safeguard federated GNN training on heterogeneous clients while ensuring graph integrity. Moreover, we propose a Secret Message Passing (SecMP) scheme to shield unauthorized access to subgraph-level and node-level sensitive information simultaneously. Theoretical analysis proves that HiFGL achieves multi-level privacy preservation with complexity guarantees. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the superiority of the proposed framework against several baselines. Furthermore, HiFGL's versatile nature allows for its application in either solely cross-silo or cross-device settings, further broadening its utility in real-world FGL applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2024</p></details> |
| **[Federated Graph Learning for EV Charging Demand Forecasting with Personalization Against Cyberattacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00742v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mitigating cybersecurity risk in electric vehicle (EV) charging demand forecasting plays a crucial role in the safe operation of collective EV chargings, the stability of the power grid, and the cost-effective infrastructure expansion. However, existing methods either suffer from the data privacy issue and the susceptibility to cyberattacks or fail to consider the spatial correlation among different stations. To address these challenges, a federated graph learning approach involving multiple charging stations is proposed to collaboratively train a more generalized deep learning model for demand forecasting while capturing spatial correlations among various stations and enhancing robustness against potential attacks. Firstly, for better model performance, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model is leveraged to characterize the geographic correlation among different charging stations in a federated manner. Secondly, to ensure robustness and deal with the data heterogeneity in a federated setting, a message passing that utilizes a global attention mechanism to aggregate personalized models for each client is proposed. Thirdly, by concerning cyberattacks, a special credit-based function is designed to mitigate potential threats from malicious clients or unwanted attacks. Extensive experiments on a public EV charging dataset are conducted using various deep learning techniques and federated learning methods to demonstrate the prediction accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 11 pages,4 figures |

However, the growing awareness of data privacy severely challenges the traditional centralized model training paradigm, where a server holds all the graph information. Federated learning is an emerging collaborative computing paradigm that allows model training without data centralization. Existing federated GNN studies mainly focus on systems where clients hold distinctive graphs or sub-graphs. The practical node-level federated situation, where each client is only aware of its direct neighbors, has yet to be studied. In this paper, we propose the first federated GNN framework called Lumos that supports supervised and unsupervised learning with feature and degree protection on node-level federated graphs. We first design a tree constructor to improve the representation capability given the limited structural information. We further present a Monte Carlo Markov Chain-based algorithm to mitigate the workload imbalance caused by degree heterogeneity with theoretically-guaranteed performance. Based on the constructed tree for each client, a decentralized tree-based GNN trainer is proposed to support versatile training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Lumos outperforms the baseline with significantly higher accuracy and greatly reduced communication cost and training time.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, published in the Proceedings of the 39th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2023)</p></details> |
| **[FedGTA: Topology-aware Averaging for Federated Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11755v1)** | 2024-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative training on large-scale subgraphs across multiple local systems. Existing FGL studies fall into two categories: (i) FGL Optimization, which improves multi-client training in existing machine learning models; (ii) FGL Model, which enhances performance with complex local models and multi-client interactions. However, most FGL optimization strategies are designed specifically for the computer vision domain and ignore graph structure, presenting dissatisfied performance and slow convergence. Meanwhile, complex local model architectures in FGL Models studies lack scalability for handling large-scale subgraphs and have deployment limitations. To address these issues, we propose Federated Graph Topology-aware Aggregation (FedGTA), a personalized optimization strategy that optimizes through topology-aware local smoothing confidence and mixed neighbor features. During experiments, we deploy FedGTA in 12 multi-scale real-world datasets with the Louvain and Metis split. This allows us to evaluate the performance and robustness of FedGTA across a range of scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedGTA achieves state-of-the-art performance while exhibiting high scalability and efficiency. The experiment includes ogbn-papers100M, the most representative large-scale graph database so that we can verify the applicability of our method to large-scale graph learning. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to bridge large-scale graph learning with FGL using this optimization strategy, contributing to the development of efficient and scalable FGL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2024</p></details> |
| **[AdaFGL: A New Paradigm for Federated Node Classification with Topology Heterogeneity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11750v1)** | 2024-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has attracted significant attention as a distributed framework based on graph neural networks, primarily due to its capability to break data silos. Existing FGL studies employ community split on the homophilous global graph by default to simulate federated semi-supervised node classification settings. Such a strategy assumes the consistency of topology between the multi-client subgraphs and the global graph, where connected nodes are highly likely to possess similar feature distributions and the same label. However, in real-world implementations, the varying perspectives of local data engineering result in various subgraph topologies, posing unique heterogeneity challenges in FGL. Unlike the well-known label Non-independent identical distribution (Non-iid) problems in federated learning, FGL heterogeneity essentially reveals the topological divergence among multiple clients, namely homophily or heterophily. To simulate and handle this unique challenge, we introduce the concept of structure Non-iid split and then present a new paradigm called \underline{Ada}ptive \underline{F}ederated \underline{G}raph \underline{L}earning (AdaFGL), a decoupled two-step personalized approach. To begin with, AdaFGL employs standard multi-client federated collaborative training to acquire the federated knowledge extractor by aggregating uploaded models in the final round at the server. Then, each client conducts personalized training based on the local subgraph and the federated knowledge extractor. Extensive experiments on the 12 graph benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of AdaFGL over state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, in terms of test accuracy, our proposed AdaFGL outperforms baselines by significant margins of 3.24\% and 5.57\% on community split and structure Non-iid split, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Individual-Level COVID-19 Infection Prediction via Federated Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06049v1)** | 2023-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting individual-level infection state is of great value since its essential role in reducing the damage of the epidemic. However, there exists an inescapable risk of privacy leakage in the fine-grained user mobility trajectories required by individual-level infection prediction. In this paper, we focus on developing a framework of privacy-preserving individual-level infection prediction based on federated learning (FL) and graph neural networks (GNN). We propose Falcon, a Federated grAph Learning method for privacy-preserving individual-level infeCtion predictiON. It utilizes a novel hypergraph structure with spatio-temporal hyperedges to describe the complex interactions between individuals and locations in the contagion process. By organically combining the FL framework with hypergraph neural networks, the information propagation process of the graph machine learning is able to be divided into two stages distributed on the server and the clients, respectively, so as to effectively protect user privacy while transmitting high-level information. Furthermore, it elaborately designs a differential privacy perturbation mechanism as well as a plausible pseudo location generation approach to preserve user privacy in the graph structure. Besides, it introduces a cooperative coupling mechanism between the individual-level prediction model and an additional region-level model to mitigate the detrimental impacts caused by the injected obfuscation mechanisms. Extensive experimental results show that our methodology outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms and is able to protect user privacy against actual privacy attacks.

| **[2SFGL: A Simple And Robust Protocol For Graph-Based Fraud Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08335v1)** | 2023-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial crime detection using graph learning improves financial safety and efficiency. However, criminals may commit financial crimes across different institutions to avoid detection, which increases the difficulty of detection for financial institutions which use local data for graph learning. As most financial institutions are subject to strict regulations in regards to data privacy protection, the training data is often isolated and conventional learning technology cannot handle the problem. Federated learning (FL) allows multiple institutions to train a model without revealing their datasets to each other, hence ensuring data privacy protection. In this paper, we proposes a novel two-stage approach to federated graph learning (2SFGL): The first stage of 2SFGL involves the virtual fusion of multiparty graphs, and the second involves model training and inference on the virtual graph. We evaluate our framework on a conventional fraud detection task based on the FraudAmazonDataset and FraudYelpDataset. Experimental results show that integrating and applying a GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) with our 2SFGL framework to the same task results in a 17.6\%-30.2\% increase in performance on several typical metrics compared to the case only using FedAvg, while integrating GraphSAGE with 2SFGL results in a 6\%-16.2\% increase in performance compared to the case only using FedAvg. We conclude that our proposed framework is a robust and simple protocol which can be simply integrated to pre-existing graph-based fraud detection methods.</p></details> | IEEE |
| **[Preserving Specificity in Federated Graph Learning for fMRI-based Neurological Disorder Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10302v1)** | 2023-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers a non-invasive approach to examining abnormal brain connectivity associated with brain disorders. Graph neural network (GNN) gains popularity in fMRI representation learning and brain disorder analysis with powerful graph representation capabilities. Training a general GNN often necessitates a large-scale dataset from multiple imaging centers/sites, but centralizing multi-site data generally faces inherent challenges related to data privacy, security, and storage burden. Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without centralized multi-site fMRI data. Unfortunately, previous FL approaches for fMRI analysis often ignore site-specificity, including demographic factors such as age, gender, and education level. To this end, we propose a specificity-aware federated graph learning (SFGL) framework for rs-fMRI analysis and automated brain disorder identification, with a server and multiple clients/sites for federated model aggregation and prediction. At each client, our model consists of a shared and a personalized branch, where parameters of the shared branch are sent to the server while those of the personalized branch remain local. This can facilitate knowledge sharing among sites and also helps preserve site specificity. In the shared branch, we employ a spatio-temporal attention graph isomorphism network to learn dynamic fMRI representations. In the personalized branch, we integrate vectorized demographic information (i.e., age, gender, and education years) and functional connectivity networks to preserve site-specific characteristics. Representations generated by the two branches are then fused for classification. Experimental results on two fMRI datasets with a total of 1,218 subjects suggest that SFGL outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

In academia, using sufficient training data to optimize a graph model on a single device is a typical approach for training a capable graph learning model. Due to privacy concerns, however, it is infeasible to do so in real-world scenarios. Federated learning provides a practical means of addressing this limitation by introducing various privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as differential privacy (DP) on the graph edges. However, although DP in federated graph learning can ensure the security of sensitive information represented in graphs, it usually causes the performance of graph learning models to degrade. In this paper, we investigate how DP can be implemented on graph edges and observe a performance decrease in our experiments. In addition, we note that DP on graph edges introduces noise that perturbs graph proximity, which is one of the graph augmentations in graph contrastive learning. Inspired by this, we propose leveraging graph contrastive learning to alleviate the performance drop resulting from DP. Extensive experiments conducted with four representative graph models on five widely used benchmark datasets show that contrastive learning indeed alleviates the models' DP-induced performance drops.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Information Sciences</p></details> |

Unlike existing wireless security techniques, LPD measures aim to conceal the entire existence of wireless communication instead of safeguarding the information transmitted from users. Motivated by LPD communication, in this paper, we study a privacy-preserving and distributed framework based on graph neural networks to minimise the detectability of a wireless ad-hoc network as a whole and predict an optimal communication region for each node in the wireless network, allowing them to communicate while remaining undetected from external actors. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of two performance measures, i.e., mean absolute error and median absolute error.</p></details> |  |

With larger parameter spaces, HGNNs may require more training data, which is often scarce in real-world applications due to privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR). Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to train a GNN collaboratively without sharing their local data. However, existing FGL methods mainly focus on homogeneous GNNs or knowledge graph embeddings; few have considered heterogeneous graphs and HGNNs. In federated heterogeneous graph learning, clients may have private graph schemas. Conventional FL/FGL methods attempting to define a global HGNN model would violate schema privacy. To address these challenges, we propose FedHGN, a novel and general FGL framework for HGNNs. FedHGN adopts schema-weight decoupling to enable schema-agnostic knowledge sharing and employs coefficients alignment to stabilize the training process and improve HGNN performance. With better privacy preservation, FedHGN consistently outperforms local training and conventional FL methods on three widely adopted heterogeneous graph datasets with varying client numbers.

Owing to the advantages of federated learning, federated graph learning (FGL) enables clients to train strong GNN models in a distributed manner without sharing their private data. A core challenge in federated systems is the non-IID problem, which also widely exists in real-world graph data. For example, local data of clients may come from diverse datasets or even domains, e.g., social networks and molecules, increasing the difficulty for FGL methods to capture commonly shared knowledge and learn a generalized encoder. From real-world graph datasets, we observe that some structural properties are shared by various domains, presenting great potential for sharing structural knowledge in FGL. Inspired by this, we propose FedStar, an FGL framework that extracts and shares the common underlying structure information for inter-graph federated learning tasks. To explicitly extract the structure information rather than encoding them along with the node features, we define structure embeddings and encode them with an independent structure encoder. Then, the structure encoder is shared across clients while the feature-based knowledge is learned in a personalized way, making FedStar capable of capturing more structure-based domain-invariant information and avoiding feature misalignment issues. We perform extensive experiments over both cross-dataset and cross-domain non-IID FGL settings, demonstrating the superiority of FedStar.</p></details> |  |

However, in some practical scenarios, graph data are stored separately in multiple distributed parties, which may not be directly shared due to conflicts of interest. Hence, federated graph neural networks are proposed to address such data silo problems while preserving the privacy of each party (or client). Nevertheless, different graph data distributions among various parties, which is known as the statistical heterogeneity, may degrade the performance of naive federated learning algorithms like FedAvg. In this paper, we propose FedEgo, a federated graph learning framework based on ego-graphs to tackle the challenges above, where each client will train their local models while also contributing to the training of a global model. FedEgo applies GraphSAGE over ego-graphs to make full use of the structure information and utilizes Mixup for privacy concerns. To deal with the statistical heterogeneity, we integrate personalization into learning and propose an adaptive mixing coefficient strategy that enables clients to achieve their optimal personalization. Extensive experimental results and in-depth analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of FedEgo.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, submitted to ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD)</p></details> |

However, federated graph learning (FGL), even though graph data are prevalent, has not been well supported due to its unique characteristics and requirements. The lack of FGL-related framework increases the efforts for accomplishing reproducible research and deploying in real-world applications. Motivated by such strong demand, in this paper, we first discuss the challenges in creating an easy-to-use FGL package and accordingly present our implemented package FederatedScope-GNN (FS-G), which provides (1) a unified view for modularizing and expressing FGL algorithms; (2) comprehensive DataZoo and ModelZoo for out-of-the-box FGL capability; (3) an efficient model auto-tuning component; and (4) off-the-shelf privacy attack and defense abilities. We validate the effectiveness of FS-G by conducting extensive experiments, which simultaneously gains many valuable insights about FGL for the community. Moreover, we employ FS-G to serve the FGL application in real-world E-commerce scenarios, where the attained improvements indicate great potential business benefits.

Specifically, in medical applications, GCNs can be used for disease prediction on a population graph, where graph nodes represent individuals and edges represent individual similarities. However, GCNs rely on a vast amount of data, which is challenging to collect for a single medical institution. In addition, a critical challenge that most medical institutions continue to face is addressing disease prediction in isolation with incomplete data information. To address these issues, Federated Learning (FL) allows isolated local institutions to collaboratively train a global model without data sharing. In this work, we propose a framework, FedNI, to leverage network inpainting and inter-institutional data via FL. Specifically, we first federatively train missing node and edge predictor using a graph generative adversarial network (GAN) to complete the missing information of local networks. Then we train a global GCN node classifier across institutions using a federated graph learning platform. The novel design enables us to build more accurate machine learning models by leveraging federated learning and also graph learning approaches. We demonstrate that our federated model outperforms local and baseline FL methods with significant margins on two public neuroimaging datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, existing work of federated learning mainly focuses on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which cannot efficiently handle graph data that are popular in many applications. Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has been proposed as one of the most promising techniques for graph learning, but its federated setting has been seldom explored. In this paper, we propose FedGraph for federated graph learning among multiple computing clients, each of which holds a subgraph. FedGraph provides strong graph learning capability across clients by addressing two unique challenges. First, traditional GCN training needs feature data sharing among clients, leading to risk of privacy leakage. FedGraph solves this issue using a novel cross-client convolution operation. The second challenge is high GCN training overhead incurred by large graph size. We propose an intelligent graph sampling algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, which can automatically converge to the optimal sampling policies that balance training speed and accuracy. We implement FedGraph based on PyTorch and deploy it on a testbed for performance evaluation. The experimental results of four popular datasets demonstrate that FedGraph significantly outperforms existing work by enabling faster convergence to higher accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TPDS</p></details> |

However, in some privacy sensitive scenarios (like finance, healthcare), training a GNN model centrally faces challenges due to the distributed data silos. Federated learning (FL) is a an emerging technique that can collaboratively train a shared model while keeping the data decentralized, which is a rational solution for distributed GNN training. We term it as federated graph learning (FGL). Although FGL has received increasing attention recently, the definition and challenges of FGL is still up in the air. In this position paper, we present a categorization to clarify it. Considering how graph data are distributed among clients, we propose four types of FGL: inter-graph FL, intra-graph FL and graph-structured FL, where intra-graph is further divided into horizontal and vertical FGL. For each type of FGL, we make a detailed discussion about the formulation and applications, and propose some potential challenges.</p></details> |  |

Graph learning (GL) tries to mine and analyze graph data so that valuable information can be discovered. Existing GL methods are designed for centralized scenarios. However, in practical scenarios, graph data are usually distributed in different organizations, i.e., the curse of isolated data islands. To address this problem, we incorporate federated learning into GL and propose a general Federated Graph Learning framework FedGL, which is capable of obtaining a high-quality global graph model while protecting data privacy by discovering the global self-supervision information during the federated training. Concretely, we propose to upload the prediction results and node embeddings to the server for discovering the global pseudo label and global pseudo graph, which are distributed to each client to enrich the training labels and complement the graph structure respectively, thereby improving the quality of each local model. Moreover, the global self-supervision enables the information of each client to flow and share in a privacy-preserving manner, thus alleviating the heterogeneity and utilizing the complementarity of graph data among different clients. Finally, experimental results show that FedGL significantly outperforms baselines on four widely used graph datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Federated Graph Learning for Collaborative Financial Crimes Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12946v2)** | 2019-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial crime is a large and growing problem, in some way touching almost every financial institution. Financial institutions are the front line in the war against financial crime and accordingly, must devote substantial human and technology resources to this effort. Current processes to detect financial misconduct have limitations in their ability to effectively differentiate between malicious behavior and ordinary financial activity. These limitations tend to result in gross over-reporting of suspicious activity that necessitate time-intensive and costly manual review. Advances in technology used in this domain, including machine learning based approaches, can improve upon the effectiveness of financial institutions' existing processes, however, a key challenge that most financial institutions continue to face is that they address financial crimes in isolation without any insight from other firms. Where financial institutions address financial crimes through the lens of their own firm, perpetrators may devise sophisticated strategies that may span across institutions and geographies. Financial institutions continue to work relentlessly to advance their capabilities, forming partnerships across institutions to share insights, patterns and capabilities. These public-private partnerships are subject to stringent regulatory and data privacy requirements, thereby making it difficult to rely on traditional technology solutions. In this paper, we propose a methodology to share key information across institutions by using a federated graph learning platform that enables us to build more accurate machine learning models by leveraging federated learning and also graph learning approaches. We demonstrated that our federated model outperforms local model by 20% with the UK FCA TechSprint data set. This new platform opens up a door to efficiently detecting global money laundering activity.</p></details> |  |
