| **[Reproducing kernel methods for machine learning, PDEs, and statistics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07084v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This monograph develops a unified, application-driven framework for kernel methods grounded in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and optimal transport (OT). Part I lays the theoretical and numerical foundations on positive-definite kernels; discrete and continuous RKHS; kernel engineering and scaling maps; error assessment via kernel discrepancy/maximum mean discrepancy (MMD); and a systematic operator view of kernels. In this viewpoint, projection, gradient, divergence, and Laplace-Beltrami operators are built directly from kernels, enabling discrete analogues of differential operators and variational tools that connect learning with PDE-style modeling. Part II turns to practice across four domains. In machine learning, we treat supervised and unsupervised tasks, then develop RKHS-based generative modeling, contrasting density and projection approaches and enhancing them with OT and scalable, combinatorial assignments. We introduce clustering strategies that reduce computational burden and support large-scale regression and transport. In physics-informed modeling, we present mesh-free kernel discretizations for elliptic and time-dependent PDEs, discuss automatic differentiation, and propose high-order discrete approximations. In reinforcement learning, we formulate kernel Q-learning and non-parametric HJB methods, and show how kernel operators yield sample-efficient baselines on continuous-state, discrete-action tasks. In mathematical finance, we build nonparametric time-series models and market generators, study benchmarking and extrapolation for pricing, and apply the framework to stress testing and portfolio methods.</p></details> | 180 pages |
| **[ResCP: Reservoir Conformal Prediction for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05060v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction offers a powerful framework for building distribution-free prediction intervals for exchangeable data. Existing methods that extend conformal prediction to sequential data rely on fitting a relatively complex model to capture temporal dependencies. However, these methods can fail if the sample size is small and often require expensive retraining when the underlying data distribution changes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Reservoir Conformal Prediction (ResCP), a novel training-free conformal prediction method for time series. Our approach leverages the efficiency and representation learning capabilities of reservoir computing to dynamically reweight conformity scores. In particular, we compute similarity scores among reservoir states and use them to adaptively reweight the observed residuals at each step. With this approach, ResCP enables us to account for local temporal dynamics when modeling the error distribution without compromising computational scalability. We prove that, under reasonable assumptions, ResCP achieves asymptotic conditional coverage, and we empirically demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Time Series Foundation Models for Short-Term Household Electricity Load Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09487v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate household electricity short-term load forecasting (STLF) is key to future and sustainable energy systems. While various studies have analyzed statistical, machine learning, or deep learning approaches for household electricity STLF, recently proposed time series foundation models such as Chronos, TimesFM or Time-MoE promise a new approach for household electricity STLF. These models are trained on a vast amount of time series data and are able to forecast time series without explicit task-specific training (zero-shot learning). In this study, we benchmark the forecasting capabilities of time series foundation models compared to Trained-from-Scratch (TFS) Transformer-based approaches. Our results suggest that foundation models perform comparably to TFS Transformer models, while certain time series foundation models outperform all TFS models when the input size increases. At the same time, they require less effort, as they need no domain-specific training and only limited contextual data for inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[FARS: Factor Augmented Regression Scenarios in R](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10679v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of macroeconomic/financial time series, the FARS package provides a comprehensive framework in R for the construction of conditional densities of the variable of interest based on the factor-augmented quantile regressions (FA-QRs) methodology, with the factors extracted from multi-level dynamic factor models (ML-DFMs) with potential overlapping group-specific factors. Furthermore, the package also allows the construction of measures of risk as well as modeling and designing economic scenarios based on the conditional densities. In particular, the package enables users to: (i) extract global and group-specific factors using a flexible multi-level factor structure; (ii) compute asymptotically valid confidence regions for the estimated factors, accounting for uncertainty in the factor loadings; (iii) obtain estimates of the parameters of the FA-QRs together with their standard deviations; (iv) recover full predictive conditional densities from estimated quantiles; (v) obtain risk measures based on extreme quantiles of the conditional densities; and (vi) estimate the conditional density and the corresponding extreme quantiles when the factors are stressed.</p></details> |  |
| **[StructuralDecompose: A Modular Framework for Robust Time Series Decomposition in R](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04974v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present StructuralDecompose, an R package for modular and interpretable time series decomposition. Unlike existing approaches that treat decomposition as a monolithic process, StructuralDecompose separates the analysis into distinct components: changepoint detection, anomaly detection, smoothing, and decomposition. This design provides flexibility and robust- ness, allowing users to tailor methods to specific time series characteristics. We demonstrate the package on simulated and real-world datasets, benchmark its performance against state-of-the- art tools such as Rbeast and autostsm, and discuss its role in interpretable machine learning workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures.

| **[MCMC for State Space models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04932v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A state-space model is a time-series model that has an unobserved latent process from which we take noisy measurements over time. The observations are conditionally independent given the latent process and the latent process itself is Markovian. These properties lead to simplifications for the conditional distribution of the latent process given the parameters and the observations. This chapter looks at how we can leverage the properties of state-space models to construct efficient MCMC samplers. We consider a range of Gibbs-sampler schemes, including those which use the forward-backward algorithm to simulate from the full conditional of the latent process given the parameters. For models where the forward-backward algorithm is not applicable we look at particle MCMC algorithms that, given the parameters, use particle filters to approximately simulate from the latent process or estimate the likelihood of the observations. Throughout, we provide intuition and informally discuss theory about the properties of the model that impact the efficiency of the different algorithms and how approaches such as reparameterization can improve mixing.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This review article is intended for the second edition of The Handbook of MCMC and is a substantial revision of the chapter of the same name that appeared in the first edition. In particular, it now describes the particle filter and particle-MCMC algorithms</p></details> |
| **[Glocal Information Bottleneck for Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04910v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Imputation (TSI), which aims to recover missing values in temporal data, remains a fundamental challenge due to the complex and often high-rate missingness in real-world scenarios. Existing models typically optimize the point-wise reconstruction loss, focusing on recovering numerical values (local information). However, we observe that under high missing rates, these models still perform well in the training phase yet produce poor imputations and distorted latent representation distributions (global information) in the inference phase. This reveals a critical optimization dilemma: current objectives lack global guidance, leading models to overfit local noise and fail to capture global information of the data. To address this issue, we propose a new training paradigm, Glocal Information Bottleneck (Glocal-IB). Glocal-IB is model-agnostic and extends the standard IB framework by introducing a Global Alignment loss, derived from a tractable mutual information approximation. This loss aligns the latent representations of masked inputs with those of their originally observed counterparts. It helps the model retain global structure and local details while suppressing noise caused by missing values, giving rise to better generalization under high missingness. Extensive experiments on nine datasets confirm that Glocal-IB leads to consistently improved performance and aligned latent representations under missingness. Our code implementation is available in https://github.com/Muyiiiii/NeurIPS-25-Glocal-IB.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Different from the Past? Spatio-Temporal Time Series Forecasting with Self-Supervised Deviation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04908v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is essential for real-world applications such as traffic management and urban computing. Although recent methods have shown improved accuracy, they often fail to account for dynamic deviations between current inputs and historical patterns. These deviations contain critical signals that can significantly affect model performance. To fill this gap, we propose ST-SSDL, a Spatio-Temporal time series forecasting framework that incorporates a Self-Supervised Deviation Learning scheme to capture and utilize such deviations. ST-SSDL anchors each input to its historical average and discretizes the latent space using learnable prototypes that represent typical spatio-temporal patterns. Two auxiliary objectives are proposed to refine this structure: a contrastive loss that enhances inter-prototype discriminability and a deviation loss that regularizes the distance consistency between input representations and corresponding prototypes to quantify deviation. Optimized jointly with the forecasting objective, these components guide the model to organize its hidden space and improve generalization across diverse input conditions. Experiments on six benchmark datasets show that ST-SSDL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics. Visualizations further demonstrate its ability to adaptively respond to varying levels of deviation in complex spatio-temporal scenarios. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Jimmy-7664/ST-SSDL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking M-LTSF: Frequency and Noise-Based Evaluation of Multivariate Long Time Series Forecasting Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04900v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the robustness of deep learning models for multivariate long-term time series forecasting (M-LTSF) remains challenging, as evaluations typically rely on real-world datasets with unknown noise properties. We propose a simulation-based evaluation framework that generates parameterizable synthetic datasets, where each dataset instance corresponds to a different configuration of signal components, noise types, signal-to-noise ratios, and frequency characteristics. These configurable components aim to model real-world multivariate time series data without the ambiguity of unknown noise. This framework enables fine-grained, systematic evaluation of M-LTSF models under controlled and diverse scenarios. We benchmark four representative architectures S-Mamba (state-space), iTransformer (transformer-based), R-Linear (linear), and Autoformer (decomposition-based). Our analysis reveals that all models degrade severely when lookback windows cannot capture complete periods of seasonal patters in the data. S-Mamba and Autoformer perform best on sawtooth patterns, while R-Linear and iTransformer favor sinusoidal signals. White and Brownian noise universally degrade performance with lower signal-to-noise ratio while S-Mamba shows specific trend-noise and iTransformer shows seasonal-noise vulnerability. Further spectral analysis shows that S-Mamba and iTransformer achieve superior frequency reconstruction. This controlled approach, based on our synthetic and principle-driven testbed, offers deeper insights into model-specific strengths and limitations through the aggregation of MSE scores and provides concrete guidance for model selection based on signal characteristics and noise conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Numbe...</summary><p>Number of pages: 13 Number of figures: 16 Number of Tables: 1 Submitted to: IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</p></details> |
| **[Fast Emulation, Modular Calibration, and Active Learning for Simulators with Functional Response](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16298v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scalable surrogate models enable efficient emulation of computer models (or simulators), particularly when dealing with large ensembles of runs. While Gaussian process (GP) models are commonly employed for emulation, they face limitations in scaling to large datasets. Furthermore, when dealing with dense functional output, such as spatial or time-series data, additional complexities arise, requiring careful handling to ensure fast emulation. This work presents a highly scalable emulator for functional data incorporating local Gaussian process regression. The emulator utilizes global GP lengthscale parameter estimates to scale the input space, leading to a substantial improvement in prediction speed. We demonstrate that our fast approximation-based emulator can serve as a viable alternative to a fully Bayesian approach for functional response, while drastically reducing computational costs. The proposed emulator is applied to quickly calibrate a multiphysics continuum hydrodynamics simulator with a large ensemble of 20000 runs. The methods presented are implemented in the R package FlaGP.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViTs: Teaching Machines to See Time Series Anomalies Like Human Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04710v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web service administrators must ensure the stability of multiple systems by promptly detecting anomalies in Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Achieving the goal of "train once, infer across scenarios" remains a fundamental challenge for time series anomaly detection models. Beyond improving zero-shot generalization, such models must also flexibly handle sequences of varying lengths during inference, ranging from one hour to one week, without retraining. Conventional approaches rely on sliding-window encoding and self-supervised learning, which restrict inference to fixed-length inputs. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities across general domains. However, when applied to time series data, they face inherent limitations due to context length. To address this issue, we propose ViTs, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based framework that converts time series curves into visual representations. By rescaling time series images, temporal dependencies are preserved while maintaining a consistent input size, thereby enabling efficient processing of arbitrarily long sequences without context constraints. Training VLMs for this purpose introduces unique challenges, primarily due to the scarcity of aligned time series image-text data. To overcome this, we employ an evolutionary algorithm to automatically generate thousands of high-quality image-text pairs and design a three-stage training pipeline consisting of: (1) time series knowledge injection, (2) anomaly detection enhancement, and (3) anomaly reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTs substantially enhance the ability of VLMs to understand and detect anomalies in time series data. All datasets and code will be publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ViTs-C484/.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Noise or Signal? Deconstructing Contradictions and An Adaptive Remedy for Reversible Normalization in Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04667v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reversible Instance Normalization (RevIN) is a key technique enabling simple linear models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in time series forecasting. While replacing its non-robust statistics with robust counterparts (termed R$^2$-IN) seems like a straightforward improvement, our findings reveal a far more complex reality. This paper deconstructs the perplexing performance of various normalization strategies by identifying four underlying theoretical contradictions. Our experiments provide two crucial findings: first, the standard RevIN catastrophically fails on datasets with extreme outliers, where its MSE surges by a staggering 683\%. Second, while the simple R$^2$-IN prevents this failure and unexpectedly emerges as the best overall performer, our adaptive model (A-IN), designed to test a diagnostics-driven heuristic, unexpectedly suffers a complete and systemic failure. This surprising outcome uncovers a critical, overlooked pitfall in time series analysis: the instability introduced by a simple or counter-intuitive heuristic can be more damaging than the statistical issues it aims to solve. The core contribution of this work is thus a new, cautionary paradigm for time series normalization: a shift from a blind search for complexity to a diagnostics-driven analysis that reveals not only the surprising power of simple baselines but also the perilous nature of naive adaptation.</p></details> | 9pages, 6 figures |
| **[Forecasting-Based Biomedical Time-series Data Synthesis for Open Data and Robust AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04622v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The limited data availability due to strict privacy regulations and significant resource demands severely constrains biomedical time-series AI development, which creates a critical gap between data requirements and accessibility. Synthetic data generation presents a promising solution by producing artificial datasets that maintain the statistical properties of real biomedical time-series data without compromising patient confidentiality. We propose a framework for synthetic biomedical time-series data generation based on advanced forecasting models that accurately replicates complex electrophysiological signals such as EEG and EMG with high fidelity. These synthetic datasets preserve essential temporal and spectral properties of real data, which enables robust analysis while effectively addressing data scarcity and privacy challenges. Our evaluations across multiple subjects demonstrate that the generated synthetic data can serve as an effective substitute for real data and also significantly boost AI model performance. The approach maintains critical biomedical features while provides high scalability for various applications and integrates seamlessly into open-source repositories, substantially expanding resources for AI-driven biomedical research.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[The Limits of Inference in Complex Systems: When Stochastic Models Become Indistinguishable](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24977v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust inference for stochastic dynamical systems is often hampered by sparse sampling and the absence of closed-form likelihoods. We introduce a Monte Carlo path-inference framework that leverages full-path statistics and bridge processes to deliver reliable parameter estimation and model selection from coarsely sampled time series, without requiring analytical solutions. Crucially, we couple mechanistic stochastic models with their inference procedures to quantify how experimental design -specifically, sampling frequency and dataset size- governs estimator precision and model distinguishability. This analysis reveals optimal sampling regimes and sharp, resolution-dependent limits beyond which competing models become empirically indistinguishable. We validate the approach across four disparate systems -trajectories of optically trapped particles, human microbiome dynamics, social-media topic mentions, and forest population time series- recovering parameters and identifying when inference is fundamentally constrained by measurement resolution, thereby clarifying ongoing debates about dominant noise sources in these systems. Together, these results establish path-based Monte Carlo as a practical, general tool for inference and model discrimination in complex systems and provide principled guidelines for designing measurements that maximize information under real-world constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relevance-Aware Thresholding in Online Conformal Prediction for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02809v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification has received considerable interest in recent works in Machine Learning. In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in this field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP) becomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time. Indeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the miscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To evaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically considered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width minimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run coverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during the threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity of the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside or outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this paper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose enhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation (inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance of the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent abrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction intervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods while maintaining coverage validity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for The 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2025, Workshop HC@AIxIA+HYDRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Quantum generative model on bicycle-sharing system and an application](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04512v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, bicycle-sharing systems have been implemented in numerous cities, becoming integral to daily life. However, a prevalent issue arises when intensive commuting demand leads to bicycle shortages in specific areas and at particular times. To address this challenge, we employ a novel quantum machine learning model that analyzes time series data by fitting quantum time evolution to observed sequences. This model enables us to capture actual trends in bicycle counts at individual ports and identify correlations between different ports. Utilizing the trained model, we simulate the impact of proactively adding bicycles to high-demand ports on the overall rental number across the system. Given that the core of this method lies in a Monte Carlo simulation, it is anticipated to have a wide range of industrial applications.</p></details> | 8 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Wavelet Predictive Representations for Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04507v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The real world is inherently non-stationary, with ever-changing factors, such as weather conditions and traffic flows, making it challenging for agents to adapt to varying environmental dynamics. Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (NSRL) addresses this challenge by training agents to adapt rapidly to sequences of distinct Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). However, existing NSRL approaches often focus on tasks with regularly evolving patterns, leading to limited adaptability in highly dynamic settings. Inspired by the success of Wavelet analysis in time series modeling, specifically its ability to capture signal trends at multiple scales, we propose WISDOM to leverage wavelet-domain predictive task representations to enhance NSRL. WISDOM captures these multi-scale features in evolving MDP sequences by transforming task representation sequences into the wavelet domain, where wavelet coefficients represent both global trends and fine-grained variations of non-stationary changes. In addition to the auto-regressive modeling commonly employed in time series forecasting, we devise a wavelet temporal difference (TD) update operator to enhance tracking and prediction of MDP evolution. We theoretically prove the convergence of this operator and demonstrate policy improvement with wavelet task representations. Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that WISDOM significantly outperforms existing baselines in both sample efficiency and asymptotic performance, demonstrating its remarkable adaptability in complex environments characterized by non-stationary and stochastically evolving tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forking-Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04487v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While accuracy is a critical requirement for time series forecasting models, an equally important (yet often overlooked) desideratum is forecast stability across forecast creation dates (FCDs). Even highly accurate models can produce erratic revisions between FCDs, undermining stakeholder trust and disrupting downstream decision-making. To improve forecast stability, models like MQCNN, MQT, and SPADE employ a little-known but highly effective technique: forking-sequences. Unlike standard statistical and neural forecasting methods that treat each FCD independently, the forking-sequences method jointly encodes and decodes the entire time series across all FCDs, in a way mirroring time series cross-validation. Since forking sequences remains largely unknown in the broader neural forecasting community, in this work, we formalize the forking-sequences approach, and we make a case for its broader adoption. We demonstrate three key benefits of forking-sequences: (i) more stable and consistent gradient updates during training; (ii) reduced forecast variance through ensembling; and (iii) improved inference computational efficiency. We validate forking-sequences' benefits using 16 datasets from the M1, M3, M4, and Tourism competitions, showing improvements in forecast percentage change stability of 28.8%, 28.8%, 37.9%, and 31.3%, and 8.8%, on average, for MLP, RNN, LSTM, CNN, and Transformer-based architectures, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vector Copula Variational Inference and Dependent Block Posterior Approximations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01072v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The key to VI is the selection of a tractable density to approximate the Bayesian posterior. For large and complex models a common choice is to assume independence between multivariate blocks in a partition of the parameter space. While this simplifies the problem it can reduce accuracy. This paper proposes using vector copulas to capture dependence between the blocks parsimoniously. Tailored multivariate marginals are constructed using learnable transport maps. We call the resulting joint distribution a ``dependent block posterior'' approximation. Vector copula models are suggested that make tractable and flexible variational approximations. They allow for differing marginals, numbers of blocks, block sizes and forms of between block dependence. They also allow for solution of the variational optimization using efficient stochastic gradient methods. The approach is demonstrated using four different statistical models and 16 datasets which have posteriors that are challenging to approximate. This includes models that use global-local shrinkage priors for regularization, and hierarchical models for smoothing and heteroscedastic time series. In all cases, our method produces more accurate posterior approximations than benchmark VI methods that either assume block independence or factor-based dependence, at limited additional computational cost. A python package implementing the method is available on GitHub at https://github.com/YuFuOliver/VCVI_Rep_PyPackage.</p></details> |  |
| **[DALNet: A Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for High-Fidelity Day-Ahead Load Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06697v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate probabilistic load forecasting is crucial for maintaining the safety and stability of power systems. However, the mainstream approach, multi-step prediction, is hindered by cumulative errors and forecasting lags, which limits its effectiveness in probabilistic day-ahead load forecasting (PDALF). To overcome these challenges, we introduce DALNet, a novel denoising diffusion model designed to generate load curves rather than relying on direct prediction. By shifting the focus to curve generation, DALNet captures the complex distribution of actual load time-series data under specific conditions with greater fidelity. To further enhance DALNet, we propose the temporal multi-scale attention block (TMSAB), a mechanism designed to integrate both positional and temporal information for improved forecasting precision. Furthermore, we utilize kernel density estimation (KDE) to reconstruct the distribution of generated load curves and employ Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to compare them with the actual data distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that DALNet excels in load forecasting accuracy and offers a novel perspective for other predictive tasks within power systems.</p></details> | 22pages |

CSHT models the directional influence of financial news and sentiment on asset returns by extracting multivariate Granger-causal dependencies, which are encoded as directional hyperedges on the surface of a hypersphere. Attention is constrained via angular masks that preserve both temporal directionality and geometric consistency. Evaluated on S\&P 500 data from 2018 to 2023, including the 2020 COVID-19 shock, CSHT consistently outperforms baselines across return prediction, regime classification, and top-asset ranking tasks. By enforcing predictive causal structure and embedding variables in a Riemannian manifold, CSHT delivers both \emph{robust generalisation across market regimes} and \emph{transparent attribution pathways} from macroeconomic events to stock-level responses. These results suggest that CSHT is a principled and practical solution for trustworthy financial forecasting under uncertainty.</p></details> | <details><summary>6th A...</summary><p>6th ACM International Conference on AI in Finance</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Predict Chaos: Curriculum-Driven Training for Robust Forecasting of Chaotic Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04342v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting chaotic systems is a cornerstone challenge in many scientific fields, complicated by the exponential amplification of even infinitesimal prediction errors. Modern machine learning approaches often falter due to two opposing pitfalls: over-specializing on a single, well-known chaotic system (e.g., Lorenz-63), which limits generalizability, or indiscriminately mixing vast, unrelated time-series, which prevents the model from learning the nuances of any specific dynamical regime. We propose Curriculum Chaos Forecasting (CCF), a training paradigm that bridges this gap. CCF organizes training data based on fundamental principles of dynamical systems theory, creating a curriculum that progresses from simple, periodic behaviors to highly complex, chaotic dynamics. We quantify complexity using the largest Lyapunov exponent and attractor dimension, two well-established metrics of chaos. By first training a sequence model on predictable systems and gradually introducing more chaotic trajectories, CCF enables the model to build a robust and generalizable representation of dynamical behaviors. We curate a library of over 50 synthetic ODE/PDE systems to build this curriculum. Our experiments show that pre-training with CCF significantly enhances performance on unseen, real-world benchmarks. On datasets including Sunspot numbers, electricity demand, and human ECG signals, CCF extends the valid prediction horizon by up to 40% compared to random-order training and more than doubles it compared to training on real-world data alone. We demonstrate that this benefit is consistent across various neural architectures (GRU, Transformer) and provide extensive ablations to validate the importance of the curriculum's structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>MIT U...</summary><p>MIT URTC Technical Paper (Oral), 5 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Change-Point Testing for Risk Measures in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02303v3)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose novel methods for change-point testing for nonparametric estimators of expected shortfall and related risk measures in weakly dependent time series. We can detect general multiple structural changes in the tails of marginal distributions of time series under general assumptions. Self-normalization allows us to avoid the issues of standard error estimation. The theoretical foundations for our methods are functional central limit theorems, which we develop under weak assumptions. An empirical study of S&P 500 and US Treasury bond returns illustrates the practical use of our methods in detecting and quantifying instability in the tails of financial time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhaseFormer: From Patches to Phases for Efficient and Effective Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04134v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Periodicity is a fundamental characteristic of time series data and has long played a central role in forecasting. Recent deep learning methods strengthen the exploitation of periodicity by treating patches as basic tokens, thereby improving predictive effectiveness. However, their efficiency remains a bottleneck due to large parameter counts and heavy computational costs. This paper provides, for the first time, a clear explanation of why patch-level processing is inherently inefficient, supported by strong evidence from real-world data. To address these limitations, we introduce a phase perspective for modeling periodicity and present an efficient yet effective solution, PhaseFormer. PhaseFormer features phase-wise prediction through compact phase embeddings and efficient cross-phase interaction enabled by a lightweight routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhaseFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance with around 1k parameters, consistently across benchmark datasets. Notably, it excels on large-scale and complex datasets, where models with comparable efficiency often struggle. This work marks a significant step toward truly efficient and effective time series forecasting. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/neumyor/PhaseFormer_TSL</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Time Series Dynamics with Fourier Ordinary Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04133v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural ODEs (NODEs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling time series data, offering the flexibility to adapt to varying input scales and capture complex dynamics. However, they face significant challenges: first, their reliance on time-domain representations often limits their ability to capture long-term dependencies and periodic structures; second, the inherent mismatch between their continuous-time formulation and the discrete nature of real-world data can lead to loss of granularity and predictive accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose Fourier Ordinary Differential Equations (FODEs), an approach that embeds the dynamics in the Fourier domain. By transforming time-series data into the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), FODEs uncover global patterns and periodic behaviors that remain elusive in the time domain. Additionally, we introduce a learnable element-wise filtering mechanism that aligns continuous model outputs with discrete observations, preserving granularity and enhancing accuracy. Experiments on various time series datasets demonstrate that FODEs outperform existing methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. By effectively capturing both long- and short-term patterns, FODEs provide a robust framework for modeling time series dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, conference</p></details> |

Insights from Physical Laws](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04102v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the remarkable success of Foundation Models (FMs) in language modeling, there has been growing interest in developing FMs for time series prediction, given the transformative power such models hold for science and engineering. This culminated in significant success of FMs in short-range forecasting settings. However, extrapolation or long-range forecasting remains elusive for FMs, which struggle to outperform even simple baselines. This contrasts with physical laws which have strong extrapolation properties, and raises the question of the fundamental difference between the structure of neural networks and physical laws. In this work, we identify and formalize a fundamental property characterizing the ability of statistical learning models to predict more accurately outside of their training domain, hence explaining performance deterioration for deep learning models in extrapolation settings. In addition to a theoretical analysis, we present empirical results showcasing the implications of this property on current deep learning architectures. Our results not only clarify the root causes of the extrapolation gap but also suggest directions for designing next-generation forecasting models capable of mastering extrapolation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synaptic Pruning: A Biological Inspiration for Deep Learning Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09330v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synaptic pruning in biological brains removes weak connections to improve efficiency. In contrast, dropout regularization in artificial neural networks randomly deactivates neurons without considering activity-dependent pruning. We propose a magnitude-based synaptic pruning method that better reflects biology by progressively removing low-importance connections during training. Integrated directly into the training loop as a dropout replacement, our approach computes weight importance from absolute magnitudes across layers and applies a cubic schedule to gradually increase global sparsity. At fixed intervals, pruning masks permanently remove low-importance weights while maintaining gradient flow for active ones, eliminating the need for separate pruning and fine-tuning phases. Experiments on multiple time series forecasting models including RNN, LSTM, and Patch Time Series Transformer across four datasets show consistent gains. Our method ranked best overall, with statistically significant improvements confirmed by Friedman tests (p < 0.01). In financial forecasting, it reduced Mean Absolute Error by up to 20% over models with no or standard dropout, and up to 52% in select transformer models. This dynamic pruning mechanism advances regularization by coupling weight elimination with progressive sparsification, offering easy integration into diverse architectures. Its strong performance, especially in financial time series forecasting, highlights its potential as a practical alternative to conventional dropout techniques.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |

While such models are often easy to simulate from, parameter estimation remains challenging. Simulation-based inference (SBI) offers a promising way forward, but existing methods typically require large training datasets or complex architectures and frequently yield confidence (credible) regions that fail to attain their nominal values, raising doubts on the reliability of estimates for the very features that motivate the use of these models. To address these challenges, we propose a fast and accurate, sample-efficient SBI framework for amortized posterior inference applicable to intractable stochastic processes. The proposed approach relies on two main steps: first, we learn the posterior density by decomposing it sequentially across parameter dimensions. Then, we use Chebyshev polynomial approximations to efficiently generate independent posterior samples, enabling accurate inference even when Markov chain Monte Carlo methods mix poorly. We further develop novel diagnostic tools for SBI in this context, as well as post-hoc calibration techniques; the latter not only lead to performance improvements of the learned inferential tool, but also to the ability to reuse it directly with new time series of varying lengths, thus amortizing the training cost. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness on trawl processes, a class of flexible infinitely divisible models that generalize univariate Gaussian processes, applied to energy demand data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stab-QRAM: An All-Clifford Quantum Random Access Memory for Special Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26494v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum random access memories (QRAMs) are pivotal for data-intensive quantum algorithms, but existing general-purpose and domain-specific architectures are hampered by a critical bottleneck: a heavy reliance on non-Clifford gates (e.g., T-gates), which are prohibitively expensive to implement fault-tolerantly. To address this challenge, we introduce the Stabilizer-QRAM (Stab-QRAM), a domain-specific architecture tailored for data with an affine Boolean structure ($f(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$), a class of functions vital for optimization, time-series analysis, and quantum linear systems algorithms. We demonstrate that the gate interactions required to implement the matrix $A$ form a bipartite graph. By applying K\"{o}nig's edge-coloring theorem to this graph, we prove that Stab-QRAM achieves an optimal logical circuit depth of $O(\log N)$ for $N$ data items, matching its $O(\log N)$ space complexity. Critically, the Stab-QRAM is constructed exclusively from Clifford gates (CNOT and X), resulting in a zero $T$-count. This design completely circumvents the non-Clifford bottleneck, eliminating the need for costly magic state distillation and making it exceptionally suited for early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms. We highlight Stab-QRAM's utility as a resource-efficient oracle for applications in discrete dynamical systems, and as a core component in Quantum Linear Systems Algorithms, providing a practical pathway for executing data-intensive tasks on emerging quantum hardware.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers new opportunities for detecting anomalies in the ubiquitous time series data. Traditional approaches struggle with variable-length time series sequences and context-based anomalies. We propose Soft Prompt Enhanced Anomaly Recognition (SPEAR), a novel approach to leverage LLMs for anomaly detection with soft prompts and quantization. Our methodology involves quantizing and transforming the time series data into input embeddings and combining them with learnable soft prompt embeddings. These combined embeddings are then fed into a frozen LLM. The soft prompts are updated iteratively based on a cross-entropy loss, allowing the model to adapt to time series anomaly detection. The use of soft prompts helps adapt LLMs effectively to time series tasks, while quantization ensures optimal handling of sequences, as LLMs are designed to handle discrete sequences. Our experimental results demonstrate that soft prompts effectively increase LLMs' performance in downstream tasks regarding time series anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 IEEE International Conference on Autonomous and Trusted Computing (ATC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[THEMIS: Unlocking Pretrained Knowledge with Foundation Model Embeddings for Anomaly Detection in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03911v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection forms a very crucial area in several domains but poses substantial challenges. Due to time series data possessing seasonality, trends, noise, and evolving patterns (concept drift), it becomes very difficult to set a general notion of what constitutes normal behavior. Anomalies themselves could be varied, ranging from a single outlier to contextual or collective anomalies, and are normally very rare; hence, the dataset is largely imbalanced. Additional layers of complexities arise due to the problems of increased dimensionality of modern time series, real-time detection criteria, setting up appropriate detection thresholds, and arriving at results that are interpretable. To embrace these multifaceted challenges, very strong, flexible, and interpretable approaches are required. This paper presents THEMIS, a new framework for time series anomaly detection that exploits pretrained knowledge from foundation models. THEMIS extracts embeddings from the encoder of the Chronos time series foundation model and applies outlier detection techniques like Local Outlier Factor and Spectral Decomposition on the self-similarity matrix, to spot anomalies in the data. Our experiments show that this modular method achieves SOTA results on the MSL dataset and performs quite competitively on the SMAP and SWAT$^*$ datasets. Notably, THEMIS exceeds models trained specifically for anomaly detection, presenting hyperparameter robustness and interpretability by default. This paper advocates for pretrained representations from foundation models for performing efficient and adaptable anomaly detection for time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral Presentation.

| **[time2time: Causal Intervention in Hidden States to Simulate Rare Events in Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05801v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While transformer-based foundation models excel at forecasting routine patterns, two questions remain: do they internalize semantic concepts such as market regimes, or merely fit curves? And can their internal representations be leveraged to simulate rare, high-stakes events such as market crashes? To investigate this, we introduce activation transplantation, a causal intervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing the statistical moments of one event (e.g., a historical crash) onto another (e.g., a calm period) during the forward pass. This procedure deterministically steers forecasts: injecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm semantics suppresses crashes and restores stability. Beyond binary control, we find that models encode a graded notion of event severity, with the latent vector norm directly correlating with the magnitude of systemic shocks. Validated across two architecturally distinct TSFMs, Toto (decoder only) and Chronos (encoder-decoder), our results demonstrate that steerable, semantically grounded representations are a robust property of large time series transformers. Our findings provide evidence for a latent concept space that governs model predictions, shifting interpretability from post-hoc attribution to direct causal intervention, and enabling semantic "what-if" analysis for strategic stress-testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Invariant Manifolds in ReLU-Based RNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03814v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have found widespread applications in machine learning for time series prediction and dynamical systems reconstruction, and experienced a recent renaissance with improved training algorithms and architectural designs. Understanding why and how trained RNNs produce their behavior is important for scientific and medical applications, and explainable AI more generally. An RNN's dynamical repertoire depends on the topological and geometrical properties of its state space. Stable and unstable manifolds of periodic points play a particularly important role: They dissect a dynamical system's state space into different basins of attraction, and their intersections lead to chaotic dynamics with fractal geometry. Here we introduce a novel algorithm for detecting these manifolds, with a focus on piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs) employing rectified linear units (ReLUs) as their activation function. We demonstrate how the algorithm can be used to trace the boundaries between different basins of attraction, and hence to characterize multistability, a computationally important property. We further show its utility in finding so-called homoclinic points, the intersections between stable and unstable manifolds, and thus establish the existence of chaos in PLRNNs. Finally we show for an empirical example, electrophysiological recordings from a cortical neuron, how insights into the underlying dynamics could be gained through our method.</p></details> |  |

Transformer-based models have been proposed to handle both short- and long-term dependencies when predicting future values from historical data. However, studies such as those by Zeng et al. (2022) and Rizvi et al. (2025) have reported mixed results in long-term forecasting tasks. In this work, we evaluate the Gaussian-based Linear architecture introduced by Rizvi et al. (2025) and present an enhanced version called the Residual Stacked Gaussian Linear (RSGL) model. We also investigate the broader applicability of the RSGL model in additional domains, including financial time series and epidemiological data. Experimental results show that the RSGL model achieves improved prediction accuracy and robustness compared to both the baseline Gaussian Linear and Transformer-based models.</p></details> |  |

Prior deep models (DLinear, TimesNet, PatchTST, TiDE, Nonstationary Transformer, LSTNet, LSTM) usually target single facets and under-utilize unlabeled spans, limiting regime adaptivity. We propose HydroFusion-LMF, a unified framework that (i) performs a learnable trend-seasonal-residual decomposition to reduce non-stationarity, (ii) routes residuals through a compact heterogeneous expert set (linear refinement, frequency kernel, patch Transformer, recurrent memory, dynamically normalized attention), (iii) fuses expert outputs via a hydrologic context-aware gate conditioned on day-of-year phase, antecedent precipitation, local variance, flood indicators, and static basin attributes, and (iv) augments supervision with a semi-supervised multi-task objective (composite MSE/MAE + extreme emphasis + NSE/KGE, masked reconstruction, multi-scale contrastive alignment, augmentation consistency, variance-filtered pseudo-labeling). Optional adapter / LoRA layers inject a frozen foundation time-series encoder efficiently. On a ~10-year daily dataset HydroFusion-LMF attains MSE 1.0128 / MAE 0.5818, improving the strongest baseline (DLinear) by 10.2% / 10.3% and the mean baseline by 24.6% / 17.1%. We observe simultaneous MSE and MAE reductions relative to baselines. The framework balances interpretability (explicit components, sparse gating) with performance, advancing label-efficient hydrologic forecasting under non-stationarity.</p></details> | V1 |
| **[Graph Generation Powered with LLMs for Boosting Multivariate Time-Series Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03645v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sourced from multiple sensors and organized chronologically, Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) data involves crucial spatial-temporal dependencies. To capture these dependencies, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools. As explicit graphs are not inherent to MTS data, graph generation becomes a critical first step in adapting GNNs to this domain. However, existing approaches often rely solely on the data itself for MTS graph generation, leaving them vulnerable to biases from small training datasets. This limitation hampers their ability to construct effective graphs, undermining the accurate modeling of underlying dependencies in MTS data and reducing GNN performance in this field. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, K-Link, leveraging the extensive universal knowledge encoded in Large Language Models (LLMs) to reduce biases for powered MTS graph generation. To harness the knowledge within LLMs, such as physical principles, we design and extract a \textit{Knowledge-Link graph} that captures universal knowledge of sensors and their linkage. To empower MTS graph generation with the knowledge-link graph, we further introduce a graph alignment module that transfers universal knowledge from the knowledge-link graph to the graph generated from MTS data. This enhances the MTS graph quality, ensuring effective representation learning for MTS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of K-Link for superior performance on various MTS tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Source Recovery for Time-Series Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19635v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-Series (TS) data has grown in importance with the rise of Internet of Things devices like sensors, but its labeling remains costly and complex. While Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDAs) offers an effective solution, growing data privacy concerns have led to the development of Source-Free UDA (SFUDAs), enabling model adaptation to target domains without accessing source data. Despite their potential, applying existing SFUDAs to TS data is challenging due to the difficulty of transferring temporal dependencies, an essential characteristic of TS data, particularly in the absence of source samples. Although prior works attempt to address this by specific source pretraining designs, such requirements are often impractical, as source data owners cannot be expected to adhere to particular pretraining schemes. To address this, we propose Temporal Source Recovery (TemSR), a framework that leverages the intrinsic properties of TS data to generate a source-like domain and recover source temporal dependencies. With this domain, TemSR enables dependency transfer to the target domain without accessing source data or relying on source-specific designs, thereby facilitating effective and practical TS-SFUDA. TemSR features a masking recovery optimization process to generate a source-like distribution with restored temporal dependencies. This distribution is further refined through local context-aware regularization to preserve local dependencies, and anchor-based recovery diversity maximization to promote distributional diversity. Together, these components enable effective temporal dependency recovery and facilitate transfer across domains using standard UDA techniques. Extensive experiments across multiple TS tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of TemSR, which even surpasses existing TS-SFUDA methods that require source-specific designs.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS-Reasoner: Aligning Time Series Foundation Models with LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03519v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series reasoning is crucial to decision-making in diverse domains, including finance, energy usage, traffic, weather, and scientific discovery. While existing time series foundation models (TSFMs) can capture low-level dynamic patterns and provide accurate forecasting, further analysis usually requires additional background knowledge and sophisticated reasoning, which are lacking in most TSFMs but can be achieved through large language models (LLMs). On the other hand, without expensive post-training, LLMs often struggle with the numerical understanding of time series data. Although it is intuitive to integrate the two types of models, developing effective training recipes that align the two modalities for reasoning tasks is still an open challenge. To this end, we propose TS-Reasoner that aligns the latent representations of TSFMs with the textual inputs of LLMs for downstream understanding/reasoning tasks. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective method to curate diverse, synthetic pairs of time series and textual captions for alignment training. We then develop a two-stage training recipe that applies instruction finetuning after the alignment pretraining. Unlike existing works that train an LLM to take time series as inputs, we leverage a pretrained TSFM and freeze it during training. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that TS-Reasoner not only outperforms a wide range of prevailing LLMs, Vision Language Models (VLMs), and Time Series LLMs, but also achieves this with remarkable data efficiency, e.g., using less than half the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning-based Anomaly Detection Framework: A Real-time, Scalable, and Automated Approach to Anomaly Detection Across Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03486v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in large, distributed systems presents several challenges. The first challenge arises from the sheer volume of data that needs to be processed. Flagging anomalies in a high-throughput environment calls for a careful consideration of both algorithm and system design. The second challenge comes from the heterogeneity of time-series datasets that leverage such a system in production. In practice, anomaly detection systems are rarely deployed for a single use case. Typically, there are several metrics to monitor, often across several domains (e.g. engineering, business and operations). A one-size-fits-all approach rarely works, so these systems need to be fine-tuned for every application - this is often done manually. The third challenge comes from the fact that determining the root-cause of anomalies in such settings is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. Identifying (in real time) a time-series dataset that is associated causally with the anomalous time-series data is a very difficult problem. In this paper, we describe a unified framework that addresses these challenges. Reasoning based Anomaly Detection Framework (RADF) is designed to perform real time anomaly detection on very large datasets. This framework employs a novel technique (mSelect) that automates the process of algorithm selection and hyper-parameter tuning for each use case. Finally, it incorporates a post-detection capability that allows for faster triaging and root-cause determination. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RADF, powered by mSelect, surpasses state-of-the-art anomaly detection models in AUC performance for 5 out of 9 public benchmarking datasets. RADF achieved an AUC of over 0.85 for 7 out of 9 datasets, a distinction unmatched by any other state-of-the-art model.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

We propose a method to characterize papers by embedding them into two distinct "co-factor" spaces: one describing how papers send citations, and the other describing how papers receive citations. This approach presents several challenges. First, older documents cannot cite newer documents, and thus it is not clear that co-factors are even identifiable. We resolve this challenge by developing a co-factor model for asymmetric adjacency matrices with missing lower triangles and showing that identification is possible. We then frame estimation as a matrix completion problem and develop a specialized implementation of matrix completion because prior implementations are memory bound in our setting. Simulations show that our estimator has promising finite sample properties, and that naive approaches fail to recover latent co-factor structure. We leverage our estimator to investigate 255,780 papers published in statistics journals from 1898 to 2024, resulting in the most comprehensive topic model of the statistics literature to date. We find interpretable co-factors corresponding to many statistical subfields, including time series, variable selection, spatial methods, graphical models, GLM(M)s, causal inference, multiple testing, quantile regression, semiparametrics, dimension reduction, and several more.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update pre-print to post-print</p></details> |

Just as classical mean regression models, classical autoregressive methods, yielding L$^2$ point-predictions, provide rather poor predictive summaries; a much more informative approach is based on quantile (auto)regression, where the whole distribution of future observations conditional on the past is consistently recovered. Since their introduction by Koenker and Xiao in 2006, autoregressive quantile autoregression methods have become a popular and successful alternative to the traditional L$^2$ ones. Due to the lack of a widely accepted concept of multivariate quantiles, however, quantile autoregression methods so far have been limited to univariate time series. Building upon recent measure-transportation-based concepts of multivariate quantiles, we develop here a nonparametric vector quantile autoregressive approach to the analysis and prediction of (nonlinear as well as linear) multivariate time series.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we generalize the stochastic sparse sampling framework for retrieval-informed classification. Specifically, we weight window predictions by within-channel similarity and aggregate them in probability space, yielding convex series-level scores and an explicit evidence trail for explainability. Our method achieves competitive iEEG classification performance and provides practitioners with greater transparency and explainability. We evaluate our method in iEEG recordings collected in four medical centers, demonstrating its potential for reliable and explainable clinical variable-length time series classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Learning from Time Series for Health</p></details> |

The elements of the spectral density operator family are assumed to be invariant with respect to the group of isometries of the manifold. The proposed test statistic is based on the weighted periodogram operator. A Central Limit Theorem is derived to obtain the asymptotic Gaussian distribution of the proposed test statistic operator under the null hypothesis. The rate of convergence to zero, in the Hilbert--Schmidt operator norm, of the bias of the integrated empirical second and fourth order cumulant spectral density operators is obtained under the alternative hypothesis. The consistency of the test follows from the consistency of the integrated weighted periodogram operator under LRD. Practical implementation of our testing approach is based on the random projection methodology. A simulation study illustrates, in the context of spherical functional time series, the asymptotic normality of the test statistic under the null hypothesis, and its consistency under the alternative. The empirical size and power properties are also computed for different functional sample sizes, and under different scenarios.</p></details> | No comments |

The large sample behavior of the test statistics is obtained under simple and composite null hypotheses. The consistency of the test is addressed under simple null hypothesis. The simulation study provided in the Appendix illustrates the finite-sample performance of the testing procedure under different families of alternatives.</p></details> |  |

Here, by considering functional inter-individual variability as meaningful data rather than noise, we introduce VarCoNet, an enhanced self-supervised framework for robust functional connectome (FC) extraction from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. VarCoNet employs self-supervised contrastive learning to exploit inherent functional inter-individual variability, serving as a brain function encoder that generates FC embeddings readily applicable to downstream tasks even in the absence of labeled data. Contrastive learning is facilitated by a novel augmentation strategy based on segmenting rs-fMRI signals. At its core, VarCoNet integrates a 1D-CNN-Transformer encoder for advanced time-series processing, enhanced with a robust Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Our VarCoNet framework is evaluated on two downstream tasks: (i) subject fingerprinting, using rs-fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, and (ii) autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification, using rs-fMRI data from the ABIDE I and ABIDE II datasets. Using different brain parcellations, our extensive testing against state-of-the-art methods, including 13 deep learning methods, demonstrates VarCoNet's superiority, robustness, interpretability, and generalizability. Overall, VarCoNet provides a versatile and robust framework for FC analysis in rs-fMRI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accuracy Law for the Future of Deep Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02729v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep time series forecasting has emerged as a booming direction in recent years. Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100% accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics, e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

Compared with other domains, time series forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time series.</p></details> |  |

To simplify the testing procedure and improve system design for O-RAN systems, it is important to identify the dependencies among various performance measurements, which are inherently time-series and can be modeled as realizations of random processes. While information theory can be utilized as a principled foundation for mapping these dependencies, the robust estimation of such measures for random processes from real-world data remains challenging. This paper introduces AMIF-MDS, which employs aggregate mutual Information in frequency (AMIF), a practical proxy for directed information (DI), to quantify similarity and visualize inter-series dependencies with multidimensional scaling (MDS). The proposed quantile-based AMIF estimator is applied to O-RAN time-series testing data to identify dependencies among various performance measures so that we can focus on a set of ``core'' performance measures. Applying density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) to the MDS embedding groups mutually informative metrics, organically reveals the link-adaptation indicators among other clusters, and yields a ``core'' performance measure set for future learning-driven O-RAN testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Transformers for Time Series: Rank Structure, Flow-of-ranks, and Compressibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03358v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers are widely used across data modalities, and yet the principles distilled from text models often transfer imperfectly to models trained to other modalities. In this paper, we analyze Transformers through the lens of rank structure. Our focus is on the time series setting, where the structural properties of the data differ remarkably from those of text or vision. We show that time-series embeddings, unlike text or vision, exhibit sharply decaying singular value spectra: small patch sizes and smooth continuous mappings concentrate the data into low-rank subspaces. From this, we prove that the associated $Q/K/V$ projections admit accurate low-rank approximations, and that attention layers become compressible in proportion to the decay of the embedding spectrum. We introduce the concept of flow-of-ranks, a phenomenon by which nonlinear mixing across depth inflates the rank, explaining why early layers are most amenable to compression and why ranks grow with depth. Guided by these theoretical and empirical results, we use these insights to compress Chronos, a large time series foundation model, achieving a reduction of $65\%$ in inference time and $81\%$ in memory, without loss of accuracy. Our findings provide principled guidance for allocating width, depth, and heads in time series foundation models, and for exploiting their inherent compressibility.</p></details> | 42 pages |

Unlike prior health benchmarks that are either generic, clinician-facing or focused on clinical tasks (e.g., diagnosis, triage), DM-Bench introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework tailored to the unique challenges of prototyping patient-facing AI solutions in diabetes, glucose management, metabolic health and related domains. Our benchmark encompasses 7 distinct task categories, reflecting the breadth of real-world questions individuals with diabetes ask, including basic glucose interpretation, educational queries, behavioral associations, advanced decision making and long term planning. Towards this end, we compile a rich dataset comprising one month of time-series data encompassing glucose traces and metrics from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and behavioral logs (e.g., eating and activity patterns) from 15,000 individuals across three different diabetes populations (type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes/general health and wellness). Using this data, we generate a total of 360,600 personalized, contextual questions across the 7 tasks. We evaluate model performance on these tasks across 5 metrics: accuracy, groundedness, safety, clarity and actionability. Our analysis of 8 recent LLMs reveals substantial variability across tasks and metrics; no single model consistently outperforms others across all dimensions. By establishing this benchmark, we aim to advance the reliability, safety, effectiveness and practical utility of AI solutions in diabetes care.</p></details> |  |

As consumer-grade wearable sensors have made the collection of health-related behaviors commonplace, the quality, volume, and availability of such data has dramatically improved. This exploratory longitudinal N-of-1 study quantitatively assesses four years of sleep data captured via the Oura Ring, a consumer-grade sleep tracking device, along with self-reported mood data logged using eMood Tracker for iOS. After assessing the data for stationarity and computing the appropriate lag-length selection, a vector autoregressive (VAR) model was fit along with Granger causality tests to assess causal mechanisms within this multivariate time series. Oura's nightly sleep quality score was shown to Granger-cause the presence of depressed and anxious moods using a VAR(2) model.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |

To avoid placing distributional assumptions on the data, in recent years the conformal prediction method has been a popular approach for predictive inference, since it provides distribution-free coverage for any iid or exchangeable data distribution. However, in the time series setting, the strong empirical performance of conformal prediction methods is not well understood, since even short-range temporal dependence is a strong violation of the exchangeability assumption. Using predictors with "memory" -- i.e., predictors that utilize past observations, such as autoregressive models -- further exacerbates this problem. In this work, we examine the theoretical properties of split conformal prediction in the time series setting, including the case where predictors may have memory. Our results bound the loss of coverage of these methods in terms of a new "switch coefficient", measuring the extent to which temporal dependence within the time series creates violations of exchangeability. Our characterization of the coverage probability is sharp over the class of stationary, $\beta$-mixing processes. Along the way, we introduce tools that may prove useful in analyzing other predictive inference methods for dependent data.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Efficiently Generating Correlated Sample Paths from Multi-step Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02224v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many time series applications require access to multi-step forecast trajectories in the form of sample paths. Recently, time series foundation models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Transformers for Imputation: Statistical Efficiency and Uncertainty Quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02216v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imputation methods play a critical role in enhancing the quality of practical time-series data, which often suffer from pervasive missing values. Recently, diffusion-based generative imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable success compared to autoregressive and conventional statistical approaches. Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how well diffusion-based models capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies between the missing values and observed ones remains limited. Our work addresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditional diffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty in missing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity bounds based on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using transformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missing values. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputation are significantly influenced by the missing patterns. Furthermore, we validate these theoretical insights through simulation and propose a mixed-masking training strategy to enhance the imputation performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 4 figures.

Existing methods predominantly utilize the temporal mean squared error, which faces two critical challenges: (1) label autocorrelation, which leads to bias from the label sequence likelihood; (2) excessive amount of tasks, which increases with the forecast horizon and complicates optimization. To address these challenges, we propose Time-o1, a transformation-augmented learning objective tailored for time-series forecasting. The central idea is to transform the label sequence into decorrelated components with discriminated significance. Models are then trained to align the most significant components, thereby effectively mitigating label autocorrelation and reducing task amount. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Time-o1 achieves state-of-the-art performance and is compatible with various forecast models.

Existing MTS anomaly detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based, prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time series data into image representations, capturing relationships across variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pool Me Wisely: On the Effect of Pooling in Transformer-Based Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03339v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer models have become the dominant backbone for sequence modeling, leveraging self-attention to produce contextualized token representations. These are typically aggregated into fixed-size vectors via pooling operations for downstream tasks. While much of the literature has focused on attention mechanisms, the role of pooling remains underexplored despite its critical impact on model behavior. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework that rigorously characterizes the expressivity of Transformer-based models equipped with widely used pooling methods by deriving closed-form bounds on their representational capacity and the ability to distinguish similar inputs. Our analysis extends to different variations of attention formulations, demonstrating that these bounds hold across diverse architectural variants. We empirically evaluate pooling strategies across tasks requiring both global and local contextual understanding, spanning three major modalities: computer vision, natural language processing, and time-series analysis. Results reveal consistent trends in how pooling choices affect accuracy, sensitivity, and optimization behavior. Our findings unify theoretical and empirical perspectives, providing practical guidance for selecting or designing pooling mechanisms suited to specific tasks. This work positions pooling as a key architectural component in Transformer models and lays the foundation for more principled model design beyond attention alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Approach for Estimating Largest Lyapunov Exponents in One-Dimensional Chaotic Time Series Using Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04868v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and quantifying chaos from data remains challenging. We present a data-driven method for estimating the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) from one-dimensional chaotic time series using machine learning. A predictor is trained to produce out-of-sample, multi-horizon forecasts; the LLE is then inferred from the exponential growth of the geometrically averaged forecast error (GMAE) across the horizon, which serves as a proxy for trajectory divergence. We validate the approach on four canonical 1D maps-logistic, sine, cubic, and Chebyshev-achieving R2pos > 0.99 against reference LLE curves with series as short as M = 450. Among baselines, KNN yields the closest fits (KNN-R comparable; RF larger deviations). By design the estimator targets positive exponents: in periodic/stable regimes it returns values indistinguishable from zero. Noise robustness is assessed by adding zero-mean white measurement noise and summarizing performance versus the average SNR over parameter sweeps: accuracy saturates for SNRm > 30 dB and collapses below 27 dB, a conservative sensor-level benchmark. The method is simple, computationally efficient, and model-agnostic, requiring only stationarity and the presence of a dominant positive exponent. It offers a practical route to LLE estimation in experimental settings where only scalar time-series measurements are available, with extensions to higher-dimensional and irregularly sampled data left for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 2 Tables, 14 Equations</p></details> |
| **[OpenTSLM: Time-Series Language Models for Reasoning over Multivariate Medical Text- and Time-Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02410v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications. Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models (TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt, models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR, compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even 1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences, while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA. To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models open-source.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wasserstein multivariate auto-regressive models for modeling distributional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05442v6)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is focused on the statistical analysis of data consisting of a collection of multiple series of probability measures that are indexed by distinct time instants and supported over a bounded interval of the real line. By modeling these time-dependent probability measures as random objects in the Wasserstein space, we propose a new auto-regressive model for the statistical analysis of multivariate distributional time series. Using the theory of iterated random function systems, results on the second order stationarity of the solution of such a model are provided. We also propose a consistent estimator for the auto-regressive coefficients of this model. Due to the simplex constraints that we impose on the model coefficients, the proposed estimator that is learned under these constraints, naturally has a sparse structure. The sparsity allows the application of the proposed model in learning a graph of temporal dependency from multivariate distributional time series. We explore the numerical performances of our estimation procedure using simulated data. To shed some light on the benefits of our approach for real data analysis, we also apply this methodology to two data sets, respectively made of observations from age distribution in different countries and those from the bike sharing network in Paris.</p></details> |  |

While this is largely true for language and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on. Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results, relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller, dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Recent Advances in Time Series Foundation Models (BERT2S)</p></details> |

However, their robustness to continual adaptation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the extent to which TSFMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned sequentially on multiple datasets. Using synthetic datasets designed with varying degrees of periodic structure, we measure the trade-off between adaptation to new data and retention of prior knowledge. Our experiments reveal that, while fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks, it often causes significant degradation on previously learned ones, illustrating a fundamental stability-plasticity dilemma.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Capacity Expansion Modelling for Renewable Energy Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06750v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future greenhouse gas neutral energy systems will be dominated by renewable energy technologies whose energy output and utilisation is subject to uncertain weather conditions. This work proposes an algorithm for capacity expansion planning if only uncertain data is available for a year's operative parameters. When faced with multiple possible operating years, the quality of a solution derived on a single operating year's data is evaluated for all years, and the optimisation problem is iteratively modified whenever supply gaps are detected. These modifications lead to solutions with sufficient back-up capacity to overcome periods of cold dark lulls, and sufficient total annual energy supply across all years. A computational study on an energy system model of Germany for 40 different operating years shows that the iterative algorithm finds solutions that guarantee security of supply for all considered years increasing the total annual cost by 1.6-2.9% compared to a lower bound. Results also underline the importance of assessing the feasibility of energy system models using atypical time-series, combining dark lull and cold period effects.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE). Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF research.</p></details> |  |

However, without explicit structural priors -- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing -- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system behavior in entirely unobserved basins.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 figures.

When considering 51 distinct particle sizes, these curves form a high-dimensional functional time series observed over equally spaced and densely sampled grids. While high dimensionality poses statistical challenges due to the curse of dimensionality, it also offers a rich source of information that enables detailed analysis of temporal variation across short time intervals for all particle sizes. To model this complexity, we propose a multilevel functional time series framework incorporating a functional factor model to facilitate one-day-ahead forecasting. To quantify forecast uncertainty, we develop a calibration approach and a split conformal prediction approach to construct prediction intervals. Both approaches are designed to minimise the absolute difference between empirical and nominal coverage probabilities using a validation dataset. Furthermore, to improve forecast accuracy as new intraday data become available, we implement dynamic updating techniques for point and interval forecasts. The proposed methods are validated through an empirical application to hourly measurements of particulate matter in 51 size categories in London.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Our method uses two distinct losses to learn strong representations with the aim of striking an effective balance between uniformity and tolerance in the embedding space. First, TimeHUT uses a hierarchical setup to learn both instance-wise and temporal information from input time-series. Next, we integrate a temperature scheduler within the vanilla contrastive loss to balance the uniformity and tolerance characteristics of the embeddings. Additionally, a hierarchical angular margin loss enforces instance-wise and temporal contrast losses, creating geometric margins between positive and negative pairs of temporal sequences. This approach improves the coherence of positive pairs and their separation from the negatives, enhancing the capture of temporal dependencies within a time-series sample. We evaluate our approach on a wide range of tasks, namely 128 UCR and 30 UAE datasets for univariate and multivariate classification, as well as Yahoo and KPI datasets for anomaly detection. The results demonstrate that TimeHUT outperforms prior methods by considerable margins on classification, while obtaining competitive results for anomaly detection. Finally, detailed sensitivity and ablation studies are performed to evaluate different components and hyperparameters of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |

This paradox reveals a fundamental limitation: traditional community detection methods fail to capture synchronization-desynchronization patterns where entities move independently yet align during critical moments. To this end, we introduce FTSCommDetector, implementing our Temporal Coherence Architecture (TCA) to discover similar and dissimilar communities in continuous multivariate time series. Unlike existing methods that process each timestamp independently, causing unstable community assignments and missing evolving relationships, our approach maintains coherence through dual-scale encoding and static topology with dynamic attention. Furthermore, we establish information-theoretic foundations demonstrating how scale separation maximizes complementary information and introduce Normalized Temporal Profiles (NTP) for scale-invariant evaluation. As a result, FTSCommDetector achieves consistent improvements across four diverse financial markets (SP100, SP500, SP1000, Nikkei 225), with gains ranging from 3.5% to 11.1% over the strongest baselines. The method demonstrates remarkable robustness with only 2% performance variation across window sizes from 60 to 120 days, making dataset-specific tuning unnecessary, providing practical insights for portfolio construction and risk management.</p></details> |  |

A Survey and Outlook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11835v4)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis (TSA) is a longstanding research topic in the data mining community and has wide real-world significance. Compared to "richer" modalities such as language and vision, which have recently experienced explosive development and are densely connected, the time-series modality remains relatively underexplored and isolated. We notice that many recent TSA works have formed a new research field, i.e., Multiple Modalities for TSA (MM4TSA). In general, these MM4TSA works follow a common motivation: how TSA can benefit from multiple modalities. This survey is the first to offer a comprehensive review and a detailed outlook for this emerging field. Specifically, we systematically discuss three benefits: (1) reusing foundation models of other modalities for efficient TSA, (2) multimodal extension for enhanced TSA, and (3) cross-modality interaction for advanced TSA. We further group the works by the introduced modality type, including text, images, audio, tables, and others, within each perspective. Finally, we identify the gaps with future opportunities, including the reused modalities selections, heterogeneous modality combinations, and unseen tasks generalizations, corresponding to the three benefits.

Since engineering time series are governed by physical, rather than linguistic, laws, large-language-model-based AI foundation models may be ineffective or inefficient. Building on the classical innovations representation theory of Wiener, Kallianpur, and Rosenblatt, we propose Time Series GPT (TS-GPT) -- an innovations-representation-based Generative Pre-trained Transformer for engineering monitoring and control. As an example of foundation model adaptation, we consider Probabilistic Generative Forecasting, which produces future time series samples from conditional probability distributions given past realizations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TS-GPT in forecasting real-time locational marginal prices using historical data from U.S. independent system operators.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a novel multi-scale time series reshape module that effectively captures cross-period patch interactions and variable dependencies. Building on this, we develop MS-DFTVNet, the multi-scale 3D deformable convolutional framework tailored for long-term forecasting. Moreover, to handle the inherently uneven distribution of temporal features, we introduce a context-aware dynamic deformable convolution mechanism, which further enhances the model's ability to capture complex temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MS-DFTVNet not only significantly outperforms strong baselines but also achieves an average improvement of about 7.5% across six public datasets, setting new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

In practice, forecasters face thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon, where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive, transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks. Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more transparent and interpretable.</p></details> |  |
| **[CarbonX: An Open-Source Tool for Computational Decarbonization Using Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01521v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational decarbonization aims to reduce carbon emissions in computing and societal systems such as data centers, transportation, and built environments. This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts, yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable; (ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications. In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model, our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to 21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned, CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.</p></details> |  |

We address this challenge with an end-to-end approach for learning optimal drug dosing and control policies for dual vasopressor administration in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock. For realistic drug dosing, we apply action space design that accommodates discrete, continuous, and directional dosing strategies in a system that combines offline conservative Q-learning with a novel recurrent modeling in a replay buffer to capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate clinical adoption while preserving efficacy. Empirical results1 on eICU and MIMIC demonstrate that action space design profoundly influences learned behavioral policies. The proposed methods achieve improved patient outcomes of over 15% in survival improvement probability, while aligning with established clinical protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Reconstructing Brain Causal Dynamics for Subject and Task Fingerprints using fMRI Time-series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06392v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Recently, there has been a revived interest in system neuroscience causation models, driven by their unique capability to unravel complex relationships in multi-scale brain networks. In this paper, we present a novel method that leverages causal dynamics to achieve effective fMRI-based subject and task fingerprinting. Methods: By applying an implicit-explicit discretization scheme, we develop a two-timescale linear state-space model. Through data-driven identification of its parameters, the model captures causal signatures, including directed interactions among brain regions from a spatial perspective, and disentangled fast and slow dynamic modes of brain activity from a temporal perspective. These causal signatures are then integrated with: (i) a modal decomposition and projection method for model-based subject identification, and (ii) a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for learning-based task classification. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of the brain reachability landscape as a novel visualization tool, which quantitatively characterizes the maximum possible activation levels of brain regions under various fMRI tasks. Results: We evaluate the proposed approach using the Human Connectome Project dataset and demonstrate its advantage over non-causality-based methods. The obtained causal signatures are visualized and demonstrate clear biological relevance with established understandings of brain function. Conclusion: We verified the feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing brain causal signatures for subject and task fingerprinting. Additionally, our work paves the way for further studies on causal fingerprints with potential applications in both healthy controls and neurodegenerative diseases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Data-Driven Control for Nonlinear Systems Using their Digital Twins and Quadratic Funnels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01406v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines a robust data-driven approach for the safe deployment of systems with nonlinear dynamics using their imperfect digital twins. Our contribution involves proposing a method that fuses the digital twin's nominal trajectory with online, data-driven uncertainty quantification to synthesize robust tracking controllers. Specifically, we derive data-driven bounds to capture the deviations of the actual system from its prescribed nominal trajectory informed via its digital twin. Subsequently, the dataset is used in the synthesis of quadratic funnels -- robust positive invariant tubes around the nominal trajectory -- via linear matrix inequalities built on the time-series data. The resulting controller guarantees constraint satisfaction while adapting to the true system behavior through a segmented learning strategy, where each segment's controller is synthesized using uncertainty information from the previous segment. This work establishes a systematic framework for obtaining safety certificates in learning-based control of nonlinear systems with imperfect models.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

However, real-world data is limited despite its quantity, quality, and variety. The data shortage of various financial assets directly hinders the performance of machine learning models designed to trade and invest in these assets. Generative methods can mitigate this shortage. In this paper, we introduce a set of novel techniques for time series data generation (we name them Fiaingen) and assess their performance across three criteria: (a) overlap of real-world and synthetic data on a reduced dimensionality space, (b) performance on downstream machine learning tasks, and (c) runtime performance. Our experiments demonstrate that the methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across the three criteria listed above. Synthetic data generated with Fiaingen methods more closely mirrors the original time series data while keeping data generation time close to seconds - ensuring the scalability of the proposed approach. Furthermore, models trained on it achieve performance close to those trained with real-world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Eliciting Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Time Series Analysis using Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01116v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex numerical time series analysis often demands multi-step reasoning capabilities beyond current models' reach. Tasks like medical diagnosis and weather forecasting require sequential reasoning processes -- including counterfactual analysis, logical deduction, knowledge application, and multi-modal contextual integration -- that existing time series models cannot explicitly perform. While recent research has shown large language models (LLMs) can achieve sophisticated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning through reinforcement learning (RL), these advances have primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, with LLMs still demonstrating poor performance on time series tasks. We introduce Chain Of thought for Understanding Numerical Time Series (COUNTS), the first framework that trains LLMs to perform CoT reasoning across diverse time series tasks using RL with verifiable rewards. Our approach employs a Residual Vector-Quantized VAE to create high-fidelity discrete tokens that seamlessly integrate into a pre-trained LLM's vocabulary. COUNTS undergoes a two-stage training process: first, supervised fine-tuning on time series analysis tasks to master our novel representations, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization training on verifiable problems using prompting strategies that encourage explicit reasoning steps before producing final answers. Our experiments demonstrate that this RL-driven approach with intermediate CoT reasoning significantly enhances LLM performance across various time series analysis tasks, opening new possibilities for complex temporal data reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmenting LLMs for General Time Series Understanding and Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01111v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data is fundamental to decision-making in many crucial domains including healthcare, finance, and environmental science. However, analyzing this data often requires incorporating unstructured contextual information, answering domain-specific questions, and generating natural language explanations -- capabilities that traditional time series models lack due to their inability to process text. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at contextual reasoning and knowledge integration, they struggle with numerical time series due to inefficient text-based representations and limited exposure to temporal data during pretraining. We address this gap by augmenting an LLM with specialized time series perception through a patch-based encoder-decoder architecture. We train this Time Series-augmented LLM (TsLLM) on a large corpus of over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples spanning diverse analysis tasks: forecasting with contextual information, time series question-answering, pattern explanation, classification with natural language outputs, and report generation. This training enables TsLLM to leverage both its language understanding and newly acquired temporal reasoning capabilities. While not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks, TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring the integration of time series analysis with natural language -- capabilities that existing approaches cannot provide. Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding, democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural language interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamical system reconstruction from partial observations using stochastic dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01089v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning stochastic models of dynamical systems underlying observed data is of interest in many scientific fields. Here we propose a novel method for this task, based on the framework of variational autoencoders for dynamical systems. The method estimates from the data both the system state trajectories and noise time series. This approach allows to perform multi-step system evolution and supports a teacher forcing strategy, alleviating limitations of autoencoder-based approaches for stochastic systems. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach on six test problems, covering simulated and experimental data. We further show the effects of the teacher forcing interval on the nature of the internal dynamics, and compare it to the deterministic models with equivalent architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating Visceral Adiposity from Wrist-Worn Accelerometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09167v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a key marker of both metabolic health and habitual physical activity (PA). Excess VAT is highly correlated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. The mechanistic basis for this pathophysiology relates to overloading the liver with fatty acids. VAT is also a highly labile fat depot, with increased turnover stimulated by catecholamines during exercise. VAT can be measured with sophisticated imaging technologies, but can also be inferred directly from PA. We tested this relationship using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011-2014, for individuals aged 20-60 years with 7 days of accelerometry data (n=2,456 men; 2,427 women) [1]. Two approaches were used for estimating VAT from activity. The first used engineered features based on movements during gait and sleep, and then ridge regression to map summary statistics of these features into a VAT estimate. The second approach used deep neural networks trained on 24 hours of continuous accelerometry. A foundation model first mapped each 10s frame into a high-dimensional feature vector. A transformer model then mapped each day's feature vector time series into a VAT estimate, which were averaged over multiple days. For both approaches, the most accurate estimates were obtained with the addition of covariate information about subject demographics and body measurements. The best performance was obtained by combining the two approaches, resulting in VAT estimates with correlations of r=0.86. These findings demonstrate a strong relationship between PA and VAT and, by extension, between PA and metabolic health risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Predictive Modeling of Malaria Incidence in the Amhara Region, Ethiopia: Integrating Multi-Output Regression and Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01302v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malaria remains a major public health concern in Ethiopia, particularly in the Amhara Region, where seasonal and unpredictable transmission patterns make prevention and control challenging. Accurately forecasting malaria outbreaks is essential for effective resource allocation and timely interventions. This study proposes a hybrid predictive modeling framework that combines time-series forecasting, multi-output regression, and conventional regression-based prediction to forecast the incidence of malaria. Environmental variables, past malaria case data, and demographic information from Amhara Region health centers were used to train and validate the models. The multi-output regression approach enables the simultaneous prediction of multiple outcomes, including Plasmodium species-specific cases, temporal trends, and spatial variations, whereas the hybrid framework captures both seasonal patterns and correlations among predictors. The proposed model exhibits higher prediction accuracy than single-method approaches, exposing hidden patterns and providing valuable information to public health authorities. This study provides a valid and repeatable malaria incidence prediction framework that can support evidence-based decision-making, targeted interventions, and resource optimization in endemic areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Feature Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01012v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as Machine Learning (ML) models have recently received a lot of attention as a potentially more energy-efficient alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks. The non-differentiability and sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven, fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages incl. references & appendix, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Differential Privacy of Network Parameters from a System Identification Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20460v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of protecting network information from privacy system identification (SI) attacks when sharing cyber-physical system simulations. We model analyst observations of networked states as time-series outputs of a graph filter driven by differentially private (DP) nodal excitations, with the analyst aiming to infer the underlying graph shift operator (GSO). Unlike traditional SI, which estimates system parameters, we study the inverse problem: what assumptions prevent adversaries from identifying the GSO while preserving utility for legitimate analysis. We show that applying DP mechanisms to inputs provides formal privacy guarantees for the GSO, linking the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP bound to the spectral properties of the graph filter and noise covariance. More precisely, for DP Gaussian signals, the spectral characteristics of both the filter and noise covariance determine the privacy bound, with smooth filters and low-condition-number covariance yielding greater privacy.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces the Fuzzy Transformer (Fuzzformer), a novel recurrent neural network architecture combined with multi-head self-attention and fuzzy inference systems to analyze multivariate stock market data and conduct long-term time series forecasting. The method leverages LSTM networks and temporal attention to condense multivariate data into interpretable features suitable for fuzzy inference systems. The resulting architecture offers comparable forecasting performance to conventional models such as ARIMA and LSTM while providing meaningful information flow within the network. The method was examined on the real world stock market index S\&P500. Initial results show potential for interpretable forecasting and identify current performance tradeoffs, suggesting practical application in understanding and forecasting stock market behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: ERK 2025 -- 34th International Electrotechnical and Computer Science Conference, Portoro\v{z}, Slovenia, Sept. 25--26, 2025.

| **[Simultaneous estimation of the effective reproduction number and the time series of daily infections: Application to Covid-19](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21027v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The time varying effective reproduction number is an important parameter for communication and policy decisions during an epidemic. In this paper, we present new statistical methods for estimating the reproduction number based on the popular model of \citet{cori2013new} which defines the effective reproduction number based on self-exciting dynamics of new infections. Such a model is conceptually simple and less susceptible to misspecifications than more complicated multi-compartment models. However, statistical inference is challenging, and the previous literature has either relied on proxy data and/or a two-step approach in which the number of infections are first estimated. In contrast, we present a coherent Bayesian method that approximates the joint posterior of daily new infections and reproduction numbers using a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Comparing our method to the state-of-the-art three-step estimation procedure of \citet{huisman2022estimation}, both using daily confirmed cases from Switzerland in the Covid-19 epidemic and simulated data, we find that our method is more accurate in terms of point estimates and uncertainty quantification, especially near the beginning and end of an observation period.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Regression with Nonstationarity and Error Contamination: Application to the Economic Impact of Climate Change](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08591v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies a regression model with functional dependent and explanatory variables, both of which exhibit nonstationary dynamics. The model assumes that the nonstationary stochastic trends of the dependent variable are explained by those of the explanatory variables, and hence that there exists a stable long-run relationship between the two variables despite their nonstationary behavior. We also assume that the functional observations may be error-contaminated. We develop novel autocovariance-based estimation and inference methods for this model. The methodology is broadly applicable to economic and statistical functional time series with nonstationary dynamics. To illustrate our methodology and its usefulness, we apply it to evaluating the global economic impact of climate change, an issue of intrinsic importance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Visual Diagnostics Framework for District Heating Data: Enhancing Data Quality for AI-Driven Heat Consumption Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00872v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality data is a prerequisite for training reliable Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in the energy domain. In district heating networks, sensor and metering data often suffer from noise, missing values, and temporal inconsistencies, which can significantly degrade model performance. This paper presents a systematic approach for evaluating and improving data quality using visual diagnostics, implemented through an interactive web-based dashboard. The dashboard employs Python-based visualization techniques, including time series plots, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and anomaly-sensitive KPIs such as skewness and anomaly detection based on the modified z-scores. These tools al-low human experts to inspect and interpret data anomalies, enabling a human-in-the-loop strategy for data quality assessment. The methodology is demonstrated on a real-world dataset from a Danish district heating provider, covering over four years of hourly data from nearly 7000 meters. The findings show how visual analytics can uncover systemic data issues and, in the future, guide data cleaning strategies that enhance the accuracy, stability, and generalizability of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit models for heat demand forecasting. The study contributes to a scalable, generalizable framework for visual data inspection and underlines the critical role of data quality in AI-driven energy management systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Energ...</summary><p>Energy Informatics.Academy Conference 2025 (EI.A 2025), 3-6 December 2025, Universiti Tenaga Nasional (UNITEN), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</p></details> |
| **[Automated flood detection from Sentinel-1 GRD time series using Bayesian analysis for change point problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19526v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based flood detection methods face critical limitations that hinder operational deployment. Supervised learning approaches require extensive labeled training data, exhibit poor geographical transferability, and may fail to adapt to new regions without additional training examples. Existing approaches do not fully exploit the rich temporal information available in SAR time series, instead relying on simple change detection between pre- and post-flood images or supplementary datasets that often introduce error propagation. These limitations prevent effective automated flood monitoring in data-scarce regions where disaster response is most needed. To address these limitations, we develop a novel training-free approach by adapting Bayesian analysis for change point problems, specifically for automated flood detection from Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected time series data. Our method statistically models the temporal behavior of SAR backscatter intensity over a one-year baseline period, then computes the posterior probability of change points at flood observation dates. This approach eliminates supervised learning dependencies by using Bayesian inference to identify when backscatter deviations exceed expected normal variations, leveraging inherent statistical properties of time series data. Validation across three diverse geographical contexts using the UrbanSARFloods benchmark dataset demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional thresholding and deep learning approaches, achieving F1 scores up to 0.76. This enables immediate deployment to any region with SAR coverage, providing critical advantages for disaster response.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Federated Dynamic Modeling and Learning for Spatiotemporal Data Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04528v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an advanced Federated Learning (FL) framework for forecasting complex spatiotemporal data, improving upon recent state-of-the-art models. In the proposed approach, the original Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) module within previous Dynamic Spatial--Temporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (DSTGCRN) modeling is first replaced with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, enabling the resulting model to more effectively capture long-term dependencies inherent to time series data. The resulting architecture significantly improves the model's capacity to handle complex temporal patterns in diverse forecasting applications. Furthermore, the proposed FL framework integrates a novel Client-Side Validation (CSV) mechanism, introducing a critical validation step at the client level before incorporating aggregated parameters from the central server into local models, ensuring only the most effective updates are retained and improving both the robustness and accuracy of the forecasting model across clients. The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on real-world applications, including public datasets for multimodal transport demand forecasting and private datasets for Origin-Destination (OD) matrix forecasting in urban areas. The results demonstrate substantial improvements over conventional methods, highlighting the framework's ability to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies while preserving data privacy. This work not only provides a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for real-time, region-specific forecasting and management but also underscores the potential of leveraging distributed data sources in a FL context. We provide our algorithms as open-source on GitHub</p></details> |  |
| **[TShape: Rescuing Machine Learning Models from Complex Shapelet Anomalies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00680v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is critical for maintaining the reliability of modern IT infrastructures, where complex anomalies frequently arise in highly dynamic environments. In this paper, we present TShape, a novel framework designed to address the challenges in industrial time series anomaly detection. Existing methods often struggle to detect shapelet anomalies that manifest as complex shape deviations, which appear obvious to human experts but prove challenging for machine learning algorithms. TShape introduces a patch-wise dual attention mechanism with multi-scale convolution to model intricate sub-sequence variations by balancing local, fine-grained shape features with global contextual dependencies. Our extensive evaluation on five diverse benchmarks demonstrates that TShape outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving an average 10\% F1 score improvement in anomaly detection. Additionally, ablation studies and attention visualizations confirm the essential contributions of each component, highlighting the robustness and adaptability of TShape to complex shapelet shapes in time series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memory Determines Learning Direction: A Theory of Gradient-Based Optimization in State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00563v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models (SSMs) have gained attention by showing potential to outperform Transformers. However, previous studies have not sufficiently addressed the mechanisms underlying their high performance owing to a lack of theoretical explanation of SSMs' learning dynamics. In this study, we provide such an explanation and propose an improved training strategy. The memory capacity of SSMs can be evaluated by examining how input time series are stored in their current state. Such an examination reveals a tradeoff between memory accuracy and length, as well as the theoretical equivalence between the structured state space sequence model (S4) and a simplified S4 with diagonal recurrent weights. This theoretical foundation allows us to elucidate the learning dynamics, proving the importance of initial parameters. Our analytical results suggest that successful learning requires the initial memory structure to be the longest possible even if memory accuracy may deteriorate or the gradient lose the teacher information. Experiments on tasks requiring long memory confirmed that extending memory is difficult, emphasizing the importance of initialization. Furthermore, we found that fixing recurrent weights can be more advantageous than adapting them because it achieves comparable or even higher performance with faster convergence. Our results provide a new theoretical foundation for SSMs and potentially offer a novel optimization strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian power spectral density estimation for LISA noise based on P-splines with a parametric boost](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00533v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flexible and efficient noise characterization is crucial for the precise estimation of gravitational wave parameters. We introduce a fast and accurate Bayesian method for estimating the power spectral density (PSD) of long, stationary time series tailored specifically for LISA data analysis. Our approach models the PSD as a geometric mean of a parametric and a nonparametric component, combining the computational efficiency of parametric models with the flexibility to capture deviations from theoretical expectations. The nonparametric component is expressed by a mixture of penalized B-splines. Adaptive, data-driven knot placement performed once during initialization eliminates computationally expensive reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo, while hierarchical roughness penalty priors prevent overfitting. This design yields stable, flexible PSD estimates with runtimes of minutes instead of hours. Validation on simulated autoregressive AR(4) data demonstrates estimator consistency. It shows that well-matched parametric components reduce the integrated absolute error compared to an uninformative baseline, requiring fewer spline knots to achieve comparable accuracy. Applied to a year of simulated LISA $X$-channel noise, our method achieves relative integrated absolute errors of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ with computation times less than three minutes, which makes it suitable for iterative analysis pipelines and multi-year mission datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Pattern-Specific Experts for Time Series Forecasting Under Patch-level Distribution Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09836v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting, which aims to predict future values based on historical data, has garnered significant attention due to its broad range of applications. However, real-world time series often exhibit complex non-uniform distribution with varying patterns across segments, such as season, operating condition, or semantic meaning, making accurate forecasting challenging. Existing approaches, which typically train a single model to capture all these diverse patterns, often struggle with the pattern drifts between patches and may lead to poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose TFPS, a novel architecture that leverages pattern-specific experts for more accurate and adaptable time series forecasting. TFPS employs a dual-domain encoder to capture both time-domain and frequency-domain features, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of temporal dynamics. It then uses subspace clustering to dynamically identify distinct patterns across data patches. Finally, pattern-specific experts model these unique patterns, delivering tailored predictions for each patch. By explicitly learning and adapting to evolving patterns, TFPS achieves significantly improved forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TFPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in long-term forecasting, through its dynamic and pattern-aware learning approach. The data and codes are available: https://github.com/syrGitHub/TFPS.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important problem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed the tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are challenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful trajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the process would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations with LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually annotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation. However, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this end, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the effectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench contains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in AgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to the success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our benchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across all benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common benchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a key weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible automatic evaluations. We release the benchmark at: https://agent-reward-bench.github.io</p></details> |  |

The proposed filter, the trajectory measurement PMBM (TM-PMBM) filter, propagates a PMBM density on the set of target states. In prediction, the filter obtains the PMBM density on the set of trajectories over the last two time steps. This density is then updated with the set of trajectory measurements. After the update step, the PMBM posterior on the set of two-step trajectories is marginalised to obtain a PMBM density on the set of target states. The filter provides a closed-form solution for multi-target filtering based on sets of trajectory measurements, estimating the set of target states at the end of each time window.

While existing works evaluate the LLMs' tool use capability, they largely focus on the final answers yet overlook the detailed tool usage trajectory, i.e., whether tools are selected, parameterized, and ordered correctly. We introduce TRAJECT-Bench, a trajectory-aware benchmark to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' tool use capability through diverse tasks with fine-grained evaluation metrics. TRAJECT-Bench pairs high-fidelity, executable tools across practical domains with tasks grounded in production-style APIs, and synthesizes trajectories that vary in breadth (parallel calls) and depth (interdependent chains). Besides final accuracy, TRAJECT-Bench also reports trajectory-level diagnostics, including tool selection and argument correctness, and dependency/order satisfaction. Analyses reveal failure modes such as similar tool confusion and parameter-blind selection, and scaling behavior with tool diversity and trajectory length where the bottleneck of transiting from short to mid-length trajectories is revealed, offering actionable guidance for LLMs' tool use.</p></details> |  |
| **[PAD-TRO: Projection-Augmented Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04436v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have gained popularity and attention in trajectory optimization due to their capability of modeling multi-modal probability distributions. However, addressing nonlinear equality constraints, i.e, dynamic feasi- bility, remains a great challenge in diffusion-based trajectory optimization. Recent diffusion-based trajectory optimization frameworks rely on a single-shooting style approach where the denoised control sequence is applied to forward propagate the dynamical system, which cannot explicitly enforce constraints on the states and frequently leads to sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we propose a novel direct trajectory optimization approach via model-based diffusion, which directly generates a sequence of states. To ensure dynamic feasibility, we propose a gradient-free projection mechanism that is incorporated into the reverse diffusion process. Our results show that, compared to a recent state-of-the-art baseline, our approach leads to zero dynamic feasibility error and approximately 4x higher success rate in a quadrotor waypoint navigation scenario involving dense static obstacles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion^2: Dual Diffusion Model with Uncertainty-Aware Adaptive Noise for Momentary Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04365v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and efficiency in autonomous driving and human-robot interaction scenarios. Earlier studies primarily utilized sufficient observational data to predict future trajectories. However, in real-world scenarios, such as pedestrians suddenly emerging from blind spots, sufficient observational data is often unavailable (i.e. momentary trajectory), making accurate prediction challenging and increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Therefore, advancing research on pedestrian trajectory prediction under extreme scenarios is critical for enhancing traffic safety. In this work, we propose a novel framework termed Diffusion^2, tailored for momentary trajectory prediction. Diffusion^2 consists of two sequentially connected diffusion models: one for backward prediction, which generates unobserved historical trajectories, and the other for forward prediction, which forecasts future trajectories. Given that the generated unobserved historical trajectories may introduce additional noise, we propose a dual-head parameterization mechanism to estimate their aleatoric uncertainty and design a temporally adaptive noise module that dynamically modulates the noise scale in the forward diffusion process. Empirically, Diffusion^2 sets a new state-of-the-art in momentary trajectory prediction on ETH/UCY and Stanford Drone datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[NoTVLA: Narrowing of Dense Action Trajectories for Generalizable Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03895v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a pivotal advance in embodied intelligence, yet they confront critical barriers to real-world deployment, most notably catastrophic forgetting. This issue stems from their overreliance on continuous action sequences or action chunks, which inadvertently create isolated data silos that disrupt knowledge retention across tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Narrowing of Trajectory VLA (NoTVLA) framework: a novel approach that narrows its focus to sparse trajectories, thereby avoiding the catastrophic forgetting associated with dense trajectory fine-tuning. A key innovation of NoTVLA lies in its trajectory planning strategy: instead of centering on the target object's trajectory, it leverages temporal compression and spatial reasoning pruning specifically for the robot end effector's trajectory. Furthermore, training is conducted using these sparse trajectories rather than dense action trajectories, an optimization that delivers remarkable practical advantages with better performance in zero-shot. In multi-task evaluation scenarios, NoTVLA achieves superior performance and generalization compared to pi0 while operating under two critical constraints: it uses over an order of magnitude less computing power than pi0 and requires no wrist-mounted camera. This design ensures that NoTVLA's operational accuracy closely approximates that of single-task expert models. Crucially, it also preserves the model's inherent language capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization in specific scenarios, supporting unified model deployment across multiple robot platforms, and fostering a degree of generalization even when perceiving tasks from novel perspectives.</p></details> |  |

The dynamics of those agents strongly depends on their tasks, roles, or observable labels. Class-conditioned motion prediction is thus an appealing way to reduce forecast uncertainty and get more accurate predictions for heterogeneous agents. However, this is hardly explored in the prior art, especially for mobile robots and in limited data applications. In this paper, we analyse different class-conditioned trajectory prediction methods on two datasets. We propose a set of conditional pattern-based and efficient deep learning-based baselines, and evaluate their performance on robotics and outdoors datasets (TH\"OR-MAGNI and Stanford Drone Dataset). Our experiments show that all methods improve accuracy in most of the settings when considering class labels. More importantly, we observe that there are significant differences when learning from imbalanced datasets, or in new environments where sufficient data is not available. In particular, we find that deep learning methods perform better on balanced datasets, but in applications with limited data, e.g., cold start of a robot in a new environment, or imbalanced classes, pattern-based methods may be preferable.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters journal and presented at the 40th Anniversary of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, which was held in Rotterdam, Netherlands on 23-26 September, 2024</p></details> |

We present Dynamic Neural Potential Field (NPField-GPT), a learning-enhanced model predictive control (MPC) framework that couples classical optimization with a Transformer-based predictor of footprint-aware repulsive potentials. Given an occupancy sub-map, robot footprint, and optional dynamic-obstacle cues, our autoregressive NPField-GPT head forecasts a horizon of differentiable potentials that are injected into a sequential quadratic MPC program via L4CasADi, yielding real-time, constraint-aware trajectory optimization. We additionally study two baselines: (NPField-D1) static-frame decomposition and (NPField-D2) parallel MLP heads for all steps. In dynamic indoor scenarios from BenchMR and on a Husky UGV in office corridors, NPField-GPT produces safer, more conservative trajectories under motion changes, while D1/D2 offer lower latency. We also compare with the CIAO* and MPPI baselines. Across methods, the Transformer+MPC synergy preserves the transparency and stability of model-based planning while learning only the part that benefits from data: spatiotemporal collision risk.

When performing such structural edits, these methods either fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape replacement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage is available at https://follow-your-shape.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Longitudinal Flow Matching for Trajectory Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03569v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models for sequential data often struggle with sparsely sampled and high-dimensional trajectories, typically reducing the learning of dynamics to pairwise transitions. We propose \textit{Interpolative Multi-Marginal Flow Matching} (IMMFM), a framework that learns continuous stochastic dynamics jointly consistent with multiple observed time points. IMMFM employs a piecewise-quadratic interpolation path as a smooth target for flow matching and jointly optimizes drift and a data-driven diffusion coefficient, supported by a theoretical condition for stable learning. This design captures intrinsic stochasticity, handles irregular sparse sampling, and yields subject-specific trajectories. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world longitudinal neuroimaging datasets show that IMMFM outperforms existing methods in both forecasting accuracy and further downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

Prior work established that statistically efficient learning is impossible for either of these problems when the only assumptions are that the data has good coverage (concentrability) and the state-action value function of every policy is linearly realizable ($q^\pi$-realizability) (Foster et al., 2021). Recently, Tkachuk et al. (2024) gave a statistically efficient learner for policy optimization, if in addition the data is assumed to be given as trajectories. In this work we present a statistically efficient learner for policy evaluation under the same assumptions. Further, we show that the sample complexity of the learner used by Tkachuk et al. (2024) for policy optimization can be improved by a tighter analysis.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose an optimal smooth coverage trajectory planning algorithm. The algorithm consists of two stages. In the front-end, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for Points of Interest (POIs), generating an initial sequence of optimized visiting points. In the back-end, the sequence is further optimized by considering trajectory smoothness, time consumption, and obstacle avoidance. This is formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem and solved to produce a smooth coverage trajectory that satisfies these constraints. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, ensuring UAVs can smoothly cover all POIs in cluttered environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the 44th Chinese Control Conference, 2025.

However, existing methods often struggle to model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality, obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process. Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://reagan1311.github.io/mask2iv</p></details> |

However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication, the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$ on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in safeguarding sensitive data.</p></details> |  |

The importance of accurate real-time performance of the controller lies in safety considerations of situations where the dynamic system under control is affected by uncertainties and disturbances, and the controller should compensate for such phenomena in order to provide stable performance. A multiple-shooting nonlinear model-predictive control framework is proposed in this paper. This framework benefits from suitable algorithm along with readings from various sensors for genuine real-time performance with extremely high accuracy. The controller is then tested for tracking different trajectories where it demonstrates highly desirable performance in terms of both speed and accuracy. This controller shows remarkable improvement when compared to existing nonlinear model-predictive controllers in the literature that were implemented on skid-steered mobile platforms.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints, ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics data.

However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity. The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation. Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning ($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of REACT-Drive.</p></details> | 13 pages,5 figures |

In this framework, each agent in a multi-agent system is assigned a partial trajectory offline and locally approximates the unknown dynamics using a deep neural network within the Koopman operator framework. By exchanging local estimated dynamics rather than training data, agents achieve consensus on a global dynamics model without sharing their private training trajectories. Simulation studies on a surface vehicle demonstrate that DDKL-PT attains consensus with respect to the learned dynamics, with each agent achieving reasonably small approximation errors over the testing data. Furthermore, a model predictive control scheme is developed by integrating the learned Koopman dynamics with known kinematic relations. Results on goal-tracking and station-keeping tasks support that the distributedly learned dynamics are sufficiently accurate for model-based optimal control.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Trajectory Generator for High-Density Traffic and Diverse Agent-Interaction Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02627v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is fundamental to autonomous driving, as it underpins safe motion planning and collision avoidance in complex environments. However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous road environments into a structured grid representation that supports fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety. Our synthetic data also benefits downstream trajectory prediction models and enhances performance in challenging high-density scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) offers a more robust alternative by directly leveraging noisy binary comparisons over trajectories. We study the best policy identification problem in PbRL, motivated by post-training optimization of generative models, for example, during multi-turn interactions. Learning in this setting combines an offline preference dataset--potentially biased or out-of-distribution and collected from a rater of subpar 'competence'--with online pure exploration, making systematic online learning essential. To this end, we propose Posterior Sampling for Preference Learning ($\mathsf{PSPL}$), a novel algorithm inspired by Top-Two Thompson Sampling that maintains posteriors over the reward model and dynamics. We provide the first Bayesian simple regret guarantees for PbRL and introduce an efficient approximation that outperforms existing baselines on simulation and image generation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Distillation on these pre-trained models can be viewed as the process of constructing advanced trajectories within the pair to accelerate sampling. For instance, consistency model distillation develops consistent projection functions to regulate trajectories, although sampling efficiency remains a concern. Rectified flow method enforces straight trajectories to enable faster sampling, yet relies on numerical ODE solvers, which may introduce approximation errors. In this work, we bridge the gap between the consistency model and the rectified flow method by proposing a Straight Consistent Trajectory~(SCoT) model. SCoT enjoys the benefits of both approaches for fast sampling, producing trajectories with consistent and straight properties simultaneously. These dual properties are strategically balanced by targeting two critical objectives: (1) regulating the gradient of SCoT's mapping to a constant, (2) ensuring trajectory consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SCoT.</p></details> |  |

Current solutions, whether traditional position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms, and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools. Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user preferences.</p></details> |  |

A promising direction is to leverage the generalist knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large-language models by treating unusual driving scenarios as a logical reasoning task. In this work, we present Poutine, a method that uses an off-the-shelf 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) - without any additional components - to achieve robust end-to-end autonomous driving via a simple and scalable training recipe. To learn strong base driving capabilities, we first train Poutine-Base using self-supervised next-token prediction over vision, language, and trajectory (VLT) tokens, leveraging both nominal and long-tail driving data. In the second stage, we fine-tune Poutine-Base using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a small set of human preference-labeled examples. We evaluated our approach on the Waymo end-to-end driving benchmark curated for long-tail scenarios. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. Our results suggest that handcrafted tokenizers or custom architectural components added to base VLMs in prior work are not necessary to achieve strong driving performance. Instead, this work highlights the potential of scalable VLT pretraining combined with lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Selection for Fine-tuning Vision Language Models via Cross Modal Alignment Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01454v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to the best baseline for LLaVA-665k.

Advances in robot performance have increased the hopping height to greater than 4 meters and opened up the possibility for more complex aerial trajectories (i.e., behaviors). However, currently hopping robots do not directly control their aerial trajectory or transition to flight, eliminating the efficiency benefits of a hopping system. Here we show a real-time, computationally efficiency, non-linear drag compensated, trajectory generation methodology and accompanying Lyapunov-based controller. The combined system can create and follow complex aerial trajectories from liftoff to touchdown on horizontal and vertical surfaces, while maintaining strick control over the orientation at touchdown. The computational efficiency provides broad applicability across all size scales of hopping robots while maintaining applicability to quadrotors in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v6)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer flexibility to define precise motion but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) handles high-dimensional spaces with strong robustness but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. Opt2Skill generates dynamic feasible and contact-consistent reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and trains RL policies to track these optimal trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms baselines that rely on human demonstrations and inverse kinematics-based references, both in motion tracking and task success rates. Furthermore, we show that incorporating trajectories with torque information improves contact force tracking in contact-involved tasks, such as wiping a table. We have successfully transferred our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We propose TrajVLM-Gen, a two-stage framework for physics-aware image-to-video generation. First, we employ a Vision Language Model to predict coarse-grained motion trajectories that maintain consistency with real-world physics. Second, these trajectories guide video generation through attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. We build a trajectory prediction dataset based on video tracking data with realistic motion patterns. Experiments on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT demonstrate that TrajVLM-Gen outperforms existing methods, achieving competitive FVD scores of 545 on UCF-101 and 539 on MSR-VTT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Based Observer Design: A Framework for Lightweight Sensor Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00630v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient observer design and accurate sensor fusion are key in state estimation. This work proposes an optimization-based methodology, termed Trajectory Based Optimization Design (TBOD), allowing the user to easily design observers for general nonlinear systems and multi-sensor setups. Starting from parametrized observer dynamics, the proposed method considers a finite set of pre-recorded measurement trajectories from the nominal plant and exploits them to tune the observer parameters through numerical optimization. This research hinges on the classic observer's theory and Moving Horizon Estimators methodology. Optimization is exploited to ease the observer's design, providing the user with a lightweight, general-purpose sensor fusion methodology. TBOD's main characteristics are the capability to handle general sensors efficiently and in a modular way and, most importantly, its straightforward tuning procedure. The TBOD's performance is tested on a terrestrial rover localization problem, combining IMU and ranging sensors provided by Ultra Wide Band antennas, and validated through a motion-capture system. Comparison with an Extended Kalman Filter is also provided, matching its position estimation accuracy and significantly improving in the orientation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM) for Accelerated and Lightweight Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00627v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a fundamental task in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supporting efficient motion planning and real-time traffic safety management. Diffusion models have recently demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment. This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS.

Operational Competence Assessment for AI-Based Trajectory Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00619v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated driving functions increasingly rely on machine learning for tasks like perception and trajectory planning, requiring large, relevant datasets. The performance of these algorithms depends on how closely the training data matches the task. To ensure reliable functioning, it is crucial to know what is included in the dataset to assess the trained model's operational risk. We aim to enhance the safe use of machine learning in automated driving by developing a method to recognize situations that an automated vehicle has not been sufficiently trained on. This method also improves explainability by describing the dataset at a human-understandable level. We propose modeling driving data as knowledge graphs, representing driving scenes with entities and their relationships. These graphs are queried for specific sub-scene configurations to check their occurrence in the dataset. We estimate a vehicle's competence in a driving scene by considering the coverage and complexity of sub-scene configurations in the training set. Higher complexity scenes require greater coverage for high competence. We apply this method to the NuPlan dataset, modeling it with knowledge graphs and analyzing the coverage of specific driving scenes. This approach helps monitor the competence of machine learning models trained on the dataset, which is essential for trustworthy AI to be deployed in automated driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in proceedings of the 2025 IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference</p></details> |
| **[From Human Hands to Robot Arms: Manipulation Skills Transfer via Trajectory Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00491v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning diverse manipulation skills for real-world robots is severely bottlenecked by the reliance on costly and hard-to-scale teleoperated demonstrations. While human videos offer a scalable alternative, effectively transferring manipulation knowledge is fundamentally hindered by the significant morphological gap between human and robotic embodiments. To address this challenge and facilitate skill transfer from human to robot, we introduce Traj2Action,a novel framework that bridges this embodiment gap by using the 3D trajectory of the operational endpoint as a unified intermediate representation, and then transfers the manipulation knowledge embedded in this trajectory to the robot's actions. Our policy first learns to generate a coarse trajectory, which forms an high-level motion plan by leveraging both human and robot data. This plan then conditions the synthesis of precise, robot-specific actions (e.g., orientation and gripper state) within a co-denoising framework. Extensive real-world experiments on a Franka robot demonstrate that Traj2Action boosts the performance by up to 27% and 22.25% over $\pi_0$ baseline on short- and long-horizon real-world tasks, and achieves significant gains as human data scales in robot policy learning. Our project website, featuring code and video demonstrations, is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/w/Traj2Action-4A45/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic-TreeRPO: Breaking the Independent Trajectory Bottleneck with Structured Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23352v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM) rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.</p></details> | Fig.3 updated |
| **[On the joint observability of flow fields and particle properties from Lagrangian trajectories: evidence from neural data assimilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00479v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We numerically investigate the joint observability of flow states and unknown particle properties from Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) data. LPT offers time-resolved, volumetric measurements of particle trajectories, but experimental tracks are spatially sparse, potentially noisy, and may be further complicated by inertial transport, raising the question of whether both Eulerian fields and particle characteristics can be reliably inferred. To address this, we develop a data assimilation framework that couples an Eulerian flow representation with Lagrangian particle models, enabling the simultaneous inference of carrier fields and particle properties under the governing equations of disperse multiphase flow. Using this approach, we establish empirical existence proofs of joint observability across three representative regimes. In a turbulent boundary layer with noisy tracer tracks (St to 0), flow states and true particle positions are jointly observable. In homogeneous isotropic turbulence seeded with inertial particles (St ~ 1-5), we demonstrate simultaneous recovery of flow states and particle diameters, showing the feasibility of implicit particle characterization. In a compressible, shock-dominated flow, we report the first joint reconstructions of velocity, pressure, density, and inertial particle properties (diameter and density), highlighting both the potential and certain limits of observability in supersonic regimes. Systematic sensitivity studies further reveal how seeding density, noise level, and Stokes number govern reconstruction accuracy, yielding practical guidelines for experimental design. Taken together, these results show that the scope of LPT could be broadened to multiphase and high-speed flows, in which tracer and measurement fidelity are limited.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Self-Evolving Benchmarks: Synthesizing Agent Trajectories via Test-Time Exploration under Validate-by-Reproduce Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00415v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agent system designs have empowered agents with unprecedented levels of capability. However, existing agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE) framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2) problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. This work marks a paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic, self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging runway for agent development.</p></details> | <details><summary>his i...</summary><p>his is a work in progress due to methodology refinement and further evaluation</p></details> |

However, existing methods typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy, first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories, enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of real-world, ego-centric perception.</p></details> |  |

For rasterization and other tasks, it is often necessary to extract a mesh that represents the shape. Unbounded scenes with long-range camera trajectories, such as flying through a forest, pose a unique challenge for mesh extraction. A single static mesh representing all the geometric detail necessary for the full camera path can be prohibitively large. Therefore, independent meshes can be extracted for different camera views, but this approach may lead to popping artifacts during transitions. We propose a temporally coherent method for extracting meshes suitable for long-range camera trajectories in unbounded scenes represented by an occupancy function. The key idea is to perform 4D mesh extraction using a new spacetime tree structure called a binary-octree. Experiments show that, compared to existing baseline methods, our method offers superior visual consistency at a comparable cost.

Traditionally, nonconvex optimization problems are solved by forming and solving a sequence of convex optimization problems, where the cost and constraint functions are approximated locally through Taylor series expansions. This presents a challenge for functions where differentiation is expensive or unavailable. In this work, we present a derivative-free approach to form these convex approximations by computing samples of the dynamics, cost, and constraint functions and letting the solver interpolate between them. Our framework includes sample-based trajectory optimization techniques like model-predictive path integral (MPPI) control as a special case and generalizes them to enable features like multiple shooting and general equality and inequality constraints that are traditionally associated with derivative-based sequential convex programming methods. The resulting framework is simple, flexible, and capable of solving a wide variety of practical motion planning and control problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analytic Conditions for Differentiable Collision Detection in Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26459v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization-based methods are widely used for computing fast, diverse solutions for complex tasks such as collision-free movement or planning in the presence of contacts. However, most of these methods require enforcing non-penetration constraints between objects, resulting in a non-trivial and computationally expensive problem. This makes the use of optimization-based methods for planning and control challenging. In this paper, we present a method to efficiently enforce non-penetration of sets while performing optimization over their configuration, which is directly applicable to problems like collision-aware trajectory optimization. We introduce novel differentiable conditions with analytic expressions to achieve this. To enforce non-collision between non-smooth bodies using these conditions, we introduce a method to approximate polytopes as smooth semi-algebraic sets. We present several numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and compare the performance with other baseline methods recently proposed in the literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures.

The majority of existing placement campaigns either follow standard `space-filling' designs or relatively ad-hoc expert opinions. A key challenge to applying principled active learning in this setting is that Lagrangian observers are continuously advected through the vector field, so they make measurements at different locations and times. It is, therefore, important to consider the likely future trajectories of placed observers to account for the utility of candidate placement locations. To this end, we present BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories. We observe noticeable benefits of BALLAST-aided sequential observer placement strategies on both synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preemptive Spatiotemporal Trajectory Adjustment for Heterogeneous Vehicles in Highway Merging Zones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25929v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aiming at the problem of driver's perception lag and low utilization efficiency of space-time resources in expressway ramp confluence area, based on the preemptive spatiotemporal trajectory Adjustment system, from the perspective of coordinating spatiotemporal resources, the reasonable value of safe space-time distance in trajectory pre-preparation is quantitatively analyzed. The minimum safety gap required for ramp vehicles to merge into the mainline is analyzed by introducing double positioning error and spatiotemporal trajectory tracking error. A merging control strategy for autonomous driving heterogeneous vehicles is proposed, which integrates vehicle type, driving intention, and safety spatiotemporal distance. The specific confluence strategies of ramp target vehicles and mainline cooperative vehicles under different vehicle types are systematically expounded. A variety of traffic flow and speed scenarios are used for full combination simulation. By comparing the time-position-speed diagram, the vehicle operation characteristics and the dynamic difference of confluence are qualitatively analyzed, and the average speed and average delay are used as the evaluation indices to quantitatively evaluate the performance advantages of the preemptive cooperative confluence control strategy. The results show that the maximum average delay improvement rates of mainline and ramp vehicles are 90.24 % and 74.24 %, respectively. The proposed strategy can effectively avoid potential vehicle conflicts and emergency braking behaviors, improve driving safety in the confluence area, and show significant advantages in driving stability and overall traffic efficiency optimization.</p></details> |  |

However, as models evolve to next-generation architectures like Flux, established erasure methods (\textit{e.g.}, ESD, UCE, AC) exhibit degraded effectiveness, raising questions about their true mechanisms. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that concept erasure creates only an illusion of ``amnesia": rather than genuine forgetting, these methods bias sampling trajectories away from target concepts, making the erasure fundamentally reversible. This insight motivates the need to distinguish superficial safety from genuine concept removal. In this work, we propose \textbf{RevAm} (\underline{Rev}oking \underline{Am}nesia), an RL-based trajectory optimization framework that resurrects erased concepts by dynamically steering the denoising process without modifying model weights. By adapting Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to diffusion models, RevAm explores diverse recovery trajectories through trajectory-level rewards, overcoming local optima that limit existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RevAm achieves superior concept resurrection fidelity while reducing computational time by 10$\times$, exposing critical vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms and underscoring the need for more robust erasure techniques beyond trajectory manipulation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Vector sketch animation generation with differentialable motion trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25857v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sketching is a direct and inexpensive means of visual expression. Though image-based sketching has been well studied, video-based sketch animation generation is still very challenging due to the temporal coherence requirement. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end automatic generation approach for vector sketch animation. To solve the flickering issue, we introduce a Differentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT) representation that describes the frame-wise movement of stroke control points using differentiable polynomial-based trajectories. DMT enables global semantic gradient propagation across multiple frames, significantly improving the semantic consistency and temporal coherence, and producing high-framerate output. DMT employs a Bernstein basis to balance the sensitivity of polynomial parameters, thus achieving more stable optimization. Instead of implicit fields, we introduce sparse track points for explicit spatial modeling, which improves efficiency and supports long-duration video processing. Evaluations on DAVIS and LVOS datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over SOTA methods. Cross-domain validation on 3D models and text-to-video data confirms the robustness and compatibility of our approach.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

A prominent line of research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward hacking.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[SSTP: Efficient Sample Selection for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17385v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a core task in autonomous driving. However, training advanced trajectory prediction models on existing large-scale datasets is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. More critically, these datasets are highly imbalanced in scenario density, with normal driving scenes (low-moderate traffic) overwhelmingly dominating the datasets, while high-density and safety-critical cases are underrepresented. As a result, models tend to overfit low/moderate-density scenarios and perform poorly in high-density scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the SSTP framework, which constructs a compact yet density-balanced dataset tailored to trajectory prediction. SSTP consists of two main stages: (1)Extraction, where a baseline model is pretrained for a few epochs to obtain stable gradient estimates, and the dataset is partitioned by scenario density. (2)Selection, where gradient-based scores and a submodular objective select representative samples within each density category, while biased sampling emphasizes rare high-density interactions to avoid dominance by low-density cases. This approach significantly reduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Experiments on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets with recent state-of-the-art models show that SSTP achieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the data while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes and significantly reducing training time. Robust trajectory prediction depends not only on data scale but also on balancing scene density to ensure reliable performance under complex multi agent interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Encryption Cooperative Salvo Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17341v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the concept of trajectory encryption in cooperative simultaneous target interception, wherein heterogeneity in guidance principles across a team of unmanned autonomous systems is leveraged as a strategic design feature. By employing a mix of heterogeneous time-to-go formulations leading to a cooperative guidance strategy, the swarm of vehicles is able to generate diverse trajectory families. This diversity expands the feasible solution space for simultaneous target interception, enhances robustness under disturbances, and enables flexible time-to-go adjustments without predictable detouring. From an adversarial perspective, heterogeneity obscures the collective interception intent by preventing straightforward prediction of swarm dynamics, effectively acting as an encryption layer in the trajectory domain. Simulations demonstrate that the swarm of heterogeneous vehicles is able to intercept a moving target simultaneously from a diverse set of initial engagement configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[LATTE: Latent Trajectory Embedding for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03054v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This erodes trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generated image detectors that remain reliable across different generators. While recent approaches leverage diffusion denoising cues, they typically rely on single-step reconstruction errors and overlook the sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose LATTE - LATent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the evolution of latent embeddings across multiple denoising steps. Instead of treating each denoising step in isolation, LATTE captures the trajectory of these representations, revealing subtle and discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated images. Experiments on several benchmarks, such as GenImage, Chameleon, and Diffusion Forensics, show that LATTE achieves superior performance, especially in challenging cross-generator and cross-dataset scenarios, highlighting the potential of latent trajectory modeling.

| **[TR2-D2: Tree Search Guided Trajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25171v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with stochastic optimal control offers a promising framework for diffusion fine-tuning, where a pre-trained diffusion model is optimized to generate paths that lead to a reward-tilted distribution. While these approaches enable optimization without access to explicit samples from the optimal distribution, they require training on rollouts under the current fine-tuned model, making them susceptible to reinforcing sub-optimal trajectories that yield poor rewards. To overcome this challenge, we introduce TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion (TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under a stochastic optimal control objective. We validate our framework on single- and multi-objective fine-tuning of biological sequence diffusion models, highlighting the overall effectiveness of TR2-D2 for reliable reward-guided fine-tuning in discrete sequence generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Hyperparameter Tuning via Trajectory Invariance Principle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25049v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As hyperparameter tuning becomes increasingly costly at scale, efficient tuning methods are essential. Yet principles for guiding hyperparameter tuning remain limited. In this work, we seek to establish such principles by considering a broad range of hyperparameters, including batch size, learning rate, and weight decay. We identify a phenomenon we call trajectory invariance, where pre-training loss curves, gradient noise, and gradient norm exhibit invariance--closely overlapping--with respect to a quantity that combines learning rate and weight decay. This phenomenon effectively reduces the original two-dimensional hyperparameter space to one dimension, yielding an efficient tuning rule: follow the salient direction revealed by trajectory invariance. Furthermore, we refine previous scaling laws and challenge several existing viewpoints. Overall, our work proposes new principles for efficient tuning and inspires future research on scaling laws.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on the comprehensive OpenAlex dataset and employing fractional counting to avoid double attribution in co-authored work, the research maps the relative shares of AI publications across major global players. The analysis reveals a profound restructuring of the international AI research landscape. The US and the European Union (EU27), once the undisputed and established leaders, have experienced a notable decline in relative dominance, with their combined share of publications falling from over 57% in 2000 to less than 25% in 2025. In contrast, China has undergone a dramatic ascent, expanding its global share of AI publications from under 5% in 2000 to nearly 36% by 2025, thereby emerging as the single most dominant contributor. Alongside China, India has also risen substantially, consolidating a multipolar Asian research ecosystem. These empirical findings highlight the strategic implications of concentrated research output, particularly China's capacity to shape the future direction of AI innovation and standard-setting. While the study calculates the volume of AI publications (in percentage as global share) as a measure of research dominance, it also acknowledges limitations in capturing quality and impact, suggesting scholarly research areas for future work on high-impact AI scholarship.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

While stitching is historically a strength of offline reinforcement learning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown proficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly understood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably stitch. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via BC, we find two properties are needed to compose: \emph{positional equivariance} and \emph{local receptiveness}. We use these two properties to explain architecture, data, and inference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion planning, including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling. Experimental comparisions show that (1) while locality is more important than positional equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition, both are crucial (2) enabling these properties through relatively simple architecture choices can be competitive with more computationally expensive methods such as replanning or scaling data, and (3) simple inpainting-based guidance can guide architecturally compositional models to enable generalization in goal-conditioned settings.</p></details> | 9 Pages |
| **[Trajectory Prediction via Bayesian Intention Inference under Unknown Goals and Kinematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24928v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces an adaptive Bayesian algorithm for real-time trajectory prediction via intention inference, where a target's intentions and motion characteristics are unknown and subject to change. The method concurrently estimates two critical variables: the target's current intention, modeled as a Markovian latent state, and an intention parameter that describes the target's adherence to a shortest-path policy. By integrating this joint update technique, the algorithm maintains robustness against abrupt intention shifts and unknown motion dynamics. A sampling-based trajectory prediction mechanism then exploits these adaptive estimates to generate probabilistic forecasts with quantified uncertainty. We validate the framework through numerical experiments: Ablation studies of two cases, and a 500-trial Monte Carlo analysis; Hardware demonstrations on quadrotor and quadrupedal platforms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms non-adaptive and partially adaptive methods. The method operates in real time around 270 Hz without requiring training or detailed prior knowledge of target behavior, showcasing its applicability in various robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

While these approaches make more realistic motions possible, they are limited by the amount of available motion data, and do not incorporate prior knowledge about the physical laws governing the system and its interactions with the environment. Thus they may violate such laws, leading to divergent trajectories and sliding contacts which limit real-world stability. We address such limitations via a two-pronged learning strategy which leverages the known physics of the system and fundamental control principles. First, we encode physics priors during supervised imitation learning to promote trajectory feasibility. Second, we minimize drift at inference time by applying a proportional-integral controller directly to the generated output state. We validate our method on various locomotion behaviors for the ergoCub humanoid robot, where a physics-informed loss encourages zero contact foot velocity. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is compatible with multiple controllers on a real robot and significantly improves the accuracy and physical constraint conformity of generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Hangzhou, China, 2025</p></details> |

Despite its potential, data preparation, pre-training strategy development, and architectural design present significant challenges in constructing this model. Therefore, we introduce UniTraj, a Universal Trajectory foundation model that aims to address these limitations through three key innovations. First, we construct WorldTrace, an unprecedented dataset of 2.45 million trajectories with billions of GPS points spanning 70 countries, providing the diverse geographic coverage essential for region-independent modeling. Second, we develop novel pre-training strategies--Adaptive Trajectory Resampling and Self-supervised Trajectory Masking--that enable robust learning from heterogeneous trajectory data with varying sampling rates and quality. Finally, we tailor a flexible model architecture to accommodate a variety of trajectory tasks, effectively capturing complex movement patterns to support broad applicability. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior scalability, adaptability, and generalization, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal yet non-exclusive training resource.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a research paper by NeurIPS'25</p></details> |

Trajectory control represents a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However, existing methods either require substantial training resources or are specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled 3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding, STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control. Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory controllability.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we provide a multilinguistic, large-scale assessment of this similarity by systematically comparing 16 publicly available pretrained LLMs with human brain responses during natural language processing tasks in both English and Chinese. Specifically, we use ridge regression to assess the representational similarity between LLM embeddings and electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and analyze the similarity between the "neural trajectory" and the "LLM latent trajectory." This method captures key dynamic patterns, such as magnitude, angle, uncertainty, and confidence. Our findings highlight both similarities and crucial differences in processing strategies: (1) We show that middle-to-high layers of LLMs are central to semantic integration and correspond to the N400 component observed in EEG; (2) The brain exhibits continuous and iterative processing during reading, whereas LLMs often show discrete, stage-end bursts of activity, which suggests a stark contrast in their real-time semantic processing dynamics. This study could offer new insights into LLMs and neural processing, and also establish a critical framework for future investigations into the alignment between artificial intelligence and biological intelligence.</p></details> |  |

We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation. Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second, action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, accepted to CoRL 2025 LSRW workshop</p></details> |

Dataset distillation offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets. Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states, overlooking crucial information in intermediate optimization states. We address this limitation by proposing a shape-wise potential that captures the geometric structure of parameter trajectories, and an easy-to-complex matching strategy that progressively addresses parameters based on their complexity. Experiments on medical image classification tasks demonstrate that our method improves distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model accuracy comparable to training on the original datasets.

| **[Evaluation of Machine and Deep Learning Techniques for Cyclone Trajectory Regression and Status Classification by Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24146v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate cyclone forecasting is essential for minimizing loss of life, infrastructure damage, and economic disruption. Traditional numerical weather prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision, recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about 2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models, especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone prediction and integration into decision support systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPS-MTM: Capturing Pattern of Normalcy in GPS-Trajectories with self-supervised learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24031v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further reference.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |
| **[BrainPath: Generating Subject-Specific Brain Aging Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16667v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying and forecasting individual brain aging trajectories is critical for understanding neurodegenerative disease and the heterogeneity of aging, yet current approaches remain limited. Most models predict chronological age, an imperfect surrogate for biological aging, or generate synthetic MRIs that enhance data diversity but fail to capture subject-specific trajectories. Here, we present BrainPath, a 3D generative framework that learns longitudinal brain aging dynamics during training and, at inference, predicts anatomically faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan. BrainPath integrates an age calibration loss, a swap learning strategy, and an age perceptual loss to preserve subtle, biologically meaningful variations. Across held-out ADNI and an independent NACC dataset, BrainPath outperforms state-of-the-art reference models in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns. Beyond methodological innovation, BrainPath enables personalized mapping of brain aging, synthetic follow-up scan prediction, and trajectory-based analyses, providing a foundation for precision modeling of brain aging and supporting research into neurodegeneration and aging interventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hazy Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction via Physical Priors and Graph-Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24020v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a 78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range dependency modeling. Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE / minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Masked Diffusion Language Models via Consistency Trajectory Reinforcement Learning with Fewer Decoding Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23924v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) language models, offering properties such as parallel decoding, flexible generation orders, and the potential for fewer inference steps. Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored. A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal (parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding, achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO) for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks, such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct. The results demonstrate that the proposed EOSER and ASS mechanisms, together with CJ-GRPO, hold significant promise for effectively and efficiently taming MDLMs. Code: https://github.com/yjyddq/EOSER-ASS-RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables.

However, guiding these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans, appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

While LLM agents show decent effectiveness, the high computational cost of input tokens due to the ever-growing trajectory remains an efficiency concern for their applications. Efficiency is largely neglected in existing studies and agent products, and this paper fills the gap by introducing an inference-time trajectory reduction approach to reduce the cost of agents. Through analyzing existing agent trajectories, we demonstrate that useless, redundant, and expired information is widespread in all trajectories, which can be identified and reduced without harming the agent's performance. We then design a simple yet effective trajectory reduction approach, AgentDiet, which automatically removes such waste information. We implement AgentDiet on a top-performing coding agent, and the evaluation on two LLMs and two benchmarks shows that AgentDiet can reduce input tokens by 39.9% ~ 59.7%, or the final computational cost by 21.1% ~ 35.9%, while maintaining the same agent performance. This indicates that trajectory reduction is a promising direction for agent systems.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

However, their training paradigm mainly relies on manually collected successful demonstrations, making it difficult to adapt to complex environments when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or execution biases. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a closed-loop optimization framework via active trial-and-error mechanism, it suffers from sparse rewards, high variance, and unstable optimization in long-horizon robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Trajectory-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO), an online RL-based training framework for VLA models. TGRPO leverages task analysis generated by a large language model to automatically construct dense reward functions, providing fine-grained feedback to accelerate convergence and improve credit assignment. The core of our method is a group-based strategy that samples and normalizes multiple trajectories in parallel, reducing variance through relative comparison. By integrating trajectory-level and step-level advantage estimation, TGRPO captures both global and local optimization signals without relying on a value network. Experiments on four task categories of the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that TGRPO achieves an average success rate of 80.7\%, which is 4.2\% higher than that of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and outperforms other representative RL-based post-training methods.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional approaches that rely solely on raw visual data such as camera images, our method utilizes highly compressed and informative BEV representations, which are generated by fusing multi-modal sensor data (e.g., camera and LiDAR) and aligning them with HD Maps. This unified BEV-HD Map format provides a geometrically consistent and rich scene description, enabling VLMs to perform accurate trajectory planning. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate 44.8% improvements in planning accuracy and complete collision avoidance. Our work highlights that VLMs can effectively interpret processed visual representations like BEV features, expanding their applicability beyond raw images in trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Diffusion Trajectory Alignment via Stepwise Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04832v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models have demonstrated great promise in modeling various sequence data, ranging from human language to biological sequences. Inspired by the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we propose an offline preference optimization method to approach trajectory alignment for discrete diffusion models. Instead of applying the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise alignment objectives by matching the per-step posterior. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization, is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, yields an equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design, protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 81.2 on LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.</p></details> | 22 pages, 3 figures |

While reinforcement learning offers a potential solution, it suffers from sparse rewards and the limited reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Meanwhile, existing data synthesis methods only produce chain-of-thought rationales and fail to model environmental interactions. In this paper, we propose EviPath, an evidence-anchored reasoning path synthesis paradigm for RAG agent development. EviPath comprises: (i) Abductive Subtask Planning, which decomposes the problem into sub-questions and iteratively plans an optimal solution path based on the dependencies between them; (ii) Faithful Sub-question Answering, which uses supporting evidence to construct a proxy environment to generate reasoning thoughts and answers for each sub-question; and (iii) Conversational Fine-Tuning, which formats the complete agent-environment interaction trajectory into a dialogue format suitable for Supervised Fine-Tuning. EviPath allows LLMs to learn complex reasoning and tool-use capabilities directly from synthesized data. Extensive experiments on widely-used question-answering benchmarks show that an 8B parameter model trained with EviPath-synthesized data significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a double-digit absolute EM gain of 14.7% in open-domain question answering.</p></details> |  |

With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios: weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance, which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative models for interactive systems.</p></details> |  |

The prevailing proxy-based training methods are susceptible to error propagation, while existing proxy-free approaches often use coarse constraints that limit exploration. To address these issues, we propose Trajectory-Distilled GFlowNet (TD-GFN), a novel proxy-free training framework. TD-GFN learns dense, transition-level edge rewards from offline trajectories via inverse reinforcement learning to provide rich structural guidance for efficient exploration. Crucially, to ensure robustness, these rewards are used indirectly to guide the policy through DAG pruning and prioritized backward sampling of training trajectories. This ensures that final gradient updates depend only on ground-truth terminal rewards from the dataset, thereby preventing the error propagation. Experiments show that TD-GFN significantly outperforms a broad range of existing baselines in both convergence speed and final sample quality, establishing a more robust and efficient paradigm for offline GFlowNet training.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnchDrive: Bootstrapping Diffusion Policies with Hybrid Trajectory Anchors for End-to-End Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20253v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end multi-modal planning has become a transformative paradigm in autonomous driving, effectively addressing behavioral multi-modality and the generalization challenge in long-tail scenarios. We propose AnchDrive, a framework for end-to-end driving that effectively bootstraps a diffusion policy to mitigate the high computational cost of traditional generative models. Rather than denoising from pure noise, AnchDrive initializes its planner with a rich set of hybrid trajectory anchors. These anchors are derived from two complementary sources: a static vocabulary of general driving priors and a set of dynamic, context-aware trajectories. The dynamic trajectories are decoded in real-time by a Transformer that processes dense and sparse perceptual features. The diffusion model then learns to refine these anchors by predicting a distribution of trajectory offsets, enabling fine-grained refinement. This anchor-based bootstrapping design allows for efficient generation of diverse, high-quality trajectories. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark confirm that AnchDrive sets a new state-of-the-art and shows strong generalizability</p></details> |  |
| **[R-Stitch: Dynamic Trajectory Stitching for Efficient Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17307v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) enhances the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs) but incurs substantial inference cost due to long autoregressive trajectories. Existing acceleration strategies either shorten traces via early stopping or compression, or adopt speculative decoding with a smaller model. However, speculative decoding provides limited gains when model agreement is low and rigidly enforces token-level consistency, overlooking the observation that some smaller models, when correct, produce significantly more concise reasoning traces that could reduce inference length. We introduce R-Stitch, a training-free hybrid decoding framework that leverages token-level entropy as an uncertainty proxy to delegate computation between a small language model (SLM) and an LLM. Our analysis shows that high-entropy tokens are more likely to induce errors, motivating an entropy-guided routing strategy that lets the SLM efficiently handle low-entropy tokens while delegating uncertain ones to the LLM, thereby avoiding full rollbacks and preserving answer quality. We further extend this design with R-Stitch$^{+}$, which learns an adaptive routing policy to adjust the token budget dynamically beyond fixed thresholds. By jointly reducing per-token decoding complexity and the number of generated tokens, our method achieves substantial acceleration with negligible accuracy loss. Concretely, it attains peak speedups of 3.00$\times$ on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, 3.85$\times$ on 14B, and 4.10$\times$ on QWQ-32B while maintaining accuracy comparable to full LLM decoding. Moreover, it naturally enables adaptive efficiency--accuracy trade-offs that can be tailored to diverse computational budgets without retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

In FedAVG multi-step scenarios, attackers observe only aggregated gradients, making data reconstruction challenging. Existing surrogate model methods like SME assume linear parameter trajectories, but we demonstrate this severely underestimates SGD's nonlinear complexity, fundamentally limiting attack effectiveness. We propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first method to introduce nonlinear parametric trajectory modeling for GIAs. Our approach replaces linear interpolation with learnable quadratic B\'ezier curves that capture SGD's curved characteristics through control points, combined with regularization and dvec scaling mechanisms for enhanced expressiveness. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST datasets show NL-SME significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining computational efficiency.This work exposes heightened privacy vulnerabilities in FL's multi-step update paradigm and offers novel perspectives for developing robust defense strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[FAST: Foreground-aware Diffusion with Accelerated Sampling Trajectory for Segmentation-oriented Anomaly Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20295v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial anomaly segmentation relies heavily on pixel-level annotations, yet real-world anomalies are often scarce, diverse, and costly to label. Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step, preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream segmentation tasks. We release the code at: https://github.com/Chhro123/fast-foreground-aware-anomaly-synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowDrive: moderated flow matching with data balancing for trajectory planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21961v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based planners are sensitive to the long-tailed distribution of driving data. Common maneuvers dominate datasets, while dangerous or rare scenarios are sparse. This imbalance can bias models toward the frequent cases and degrade performance on critical scenarios. To tackle this problem, we compare balancing strategies for sampling training data and find reweighting by trajectory pattern an effective approach. We then present FlowDrive, a flow-matching trajectory planner that learns a conditional rectified flow to map noise directly to trajectory distributions with few flow-matching steps. We further introduce moderated, in-the-loop guidance that injects small perturbation between flow steps to systematically increase trajectory diversity while remaining scene-consistent. On nuPlan and the interaction-focused interPlan benchmarks, FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art results among learning-based planners and approaches methods with rule-based refinements. After adding moderated guidance and light post-processing (FlowDrive*), it achieves overall state-of-the-art performance across nearly all benchmark splits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text2Move: Text-to-moving sound generation via trajectory prediction and temporal alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21919v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human auditory perception is shaped by moving sound sources in 3D space, yet prior work in generative sound modelling has largely been restricted to mono signals or static spatial audio. In this work, we introduce a framework for generating moving sounds given text prompts in a controllable fashion. To enable training, we construct a synthetic dataset that records moving sounds in binaural format, their spatial trajectories, and text captions about the sound event and spatial motion. Using this dataset, we train a text-to-trajectory prediction model that outputs the three-dimensional trajectory of a moving sound source given text prompts. To generate spatial audio, we first fine-tune a pre-trained text-to-audio generative model to output temporally aligned mono sound with the trajectory. The spatial audio is then simulated using the predicted temporally-aligned trajectory. Experimental evaluation demonstrates reasonable spatial understanding of the text-to-trajectory model. This approach could be easily integrated into existing text-to-audio generative workflow and extended to moving sound generation in other spatial audio formats.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plan-R1: Safe and Feasible Trajectory Planning as Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17659v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe and feasible trajectory planning is critical for real-world autonomous driving systems. However, existing learning-based planners rely heavily on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting undesirable behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a two-stage trajectory planning framework that decouples principle alignment from behavior learning. In the first stage, a general trajectory predictor is pre-trained on expert data to capture diverse, human-like driving behaviors. In the second stage, the model is fine-tuned with rule-based rewards using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), explicitly aligning ego planning with principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. This two-stage paradigm retains human-like behaviors while enhancing safety awareness and discarding undesirable patterns from demonstrations. Furthermore, we identify a key limitation of directly applying GRPO to planning: group-wise normalization erases cross-group scale differences, causing rare, high-variance safety-violation groups to have similar advantages as abundant low-variance safe groups, thereby suppressing optimization for safety-critical objectives. To address this, we propose Variance-Decoupled GRPO (VD-GRPO), which replaces normalization with centering and fixed scaling to preserve absolute reward magnitudes, ensuring that safety-critical objectives remain dominant throughout training. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance, particularly in realistic reactive settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/XiaolongTang23/Plan-R1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aircraft Trajectory Dataset Augmentation in Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07585v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aircraft trajectory modeling plays a crucial role in air traffic management (ATM) and is important for various downstream tasks, including conflict detection and landing time prediction. Dataset augmentation by adding synthetically generated trajectory data is necessary to develop a more robust aircraft trajectory model and ensure that the trajectory dataset is sufficient and balanced. We propose a novel framework called ATRADA for aircraft trajectory dataset augmentation. In the proposed framework, a Transformer encoder learns the underlying patterns in the original trajectory dataset and converts each data point into a context vector in the learned latent space. The converted dataset is projected to reduced dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the probability distribution of the data points in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, new samples are drawn from the fitted GMM, the dimension of the samples is reverted to the original dimension, and the samples are decoded with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Several experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively generates new, high-quality synthetic aircraft trajectory data, which were compared to the results of several baselines.</p></details> |  |

Anticipating Future Motion by Generating Point Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21592v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e., predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating pixels rather than directly modeling motion.</p></details> |  |

The framework extends traditional path planning from Euclidean position spaces to the Lie group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, allowing joint learning of translational motion and rotational dynamics. A modified Bellman-based operator is introduced to support reinforcement learning (RL) policy updates while leveraging prior trajectory information for improved convergence. $\text{GMP}^{3}$ is designed as a distributed framework in which agents influence each other and share policy information along the trajectory: each agent refines its assigned segment and shares with its neighbors via a consensus-based scheme, enabling cooperative policy updates and convergence toward a path shaped globally even under kinematic constraints. We also propose DroneManager, a modular ground control software that interfaces the planner with real UAV platforms via the MAVLink protocol, supporting real-time deployment and feedback. Simulation studies and indoor flight experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in constrained 3D environments, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance and smooth, feasible trajectories across both position and orientation.

Recently, intrinsically interpretable GNNs have been studied to provide insights into model predictions by identifying rationale substructures in graphs. However, existing methods face challenges when the underlying rationale subgraphs are complex and varied. In this work, we propose TopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning, a novel topological framework that leverages persistent homology to identify persistent rationale subgraphs. TopInG employs a rationale filtration learning approach to model an autoregressive generation process of rationale subgraphs, and introduces a self-adjusted topological constraint, termed topological discrepancy, to enforce a persistent topological distinction between rationale subgraphs and irrelevant counterparts. We provide theoretical guarantees that our loss function is uniquely optimized by the ground truth under specific conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate TopInG's effectiveness in tackling key challenges, such as handling variform rationale subgraphs, balancing predictive performance with interpretability, and mitigating spurious correlations. Results show that our approach improves upon state-of-the-art methods on both predictive accuracy and interpretation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, the effectiveness of QA algorithms is heavily based on the embedding of problem instances, represented as logical graphs, into the quantum processing unit (QPU) whose topology is in the form of a limited connectivity graph, known as the minor embedding problem. Because the minor embedding problem is an NP-hard problem~\mbox{\cite{Goodrich2018}}, existing methods for the minor embedding problem suffer from scalability issues when faced with larger problem sizes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to address the minor embedding problem, named CHARME. CHARME includes three key components: a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture for policy modeling, a state transition algorithm that ensures solution validity, and an order exploration strategy for effective training. Through comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world instances, we demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed order exploration strategy as well as our proposed RL framework, CHARME. In particular, CHARME yields superior solutions in terms of qubit usage compared to fast embedding methods such as Minorminer and ATOM. Moreover, our method surpasses the OCT-based approach, known for its slower runtime but high-quality solutions, in several cases. In addition, our proposed exploration enhances the efficiency of the training of the CHARME framework by providing better solutions compared to the greedy strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object-Centric Representation Learning for Enhanced 3D Scene Graph Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04714v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Semantic Scene Graph Prediction aims to detect objects and their semantic relationships in 3D scenes, and has emerged as a crucial technology for robotics and AR/VR applications. While previous research has addressed dataset limitations and explored various approaches including Open-Vocabulary settings, they frequently fail to optimize the representational capacity of object and relationship features, showing excessive reliance on Graph Neural Networks despite insufficient discriminative capability. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive analysis that the quality of object features plays a critical role in determining overall scene graph accuracy. To address this challenge, we design a highly discriminative object feature encoder and employ a contrastive pretraining strategy that decouples object representation learning from the scene graph prediction. This design not only enhances object classification accuracy but also yields direct improvements in relationship prediction. Notably, when plugging in our pretrained encoder into existing frameworks, we observe substantial performance improvements across all evaluation metrics. Additionally, whereas existing approaches have not fully exploited the integration of relationship information, we effectively combine both geometric and semantic features to achieve superior relationship prediction. Comprehensive experiments on the 3DSSG dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

However, current GFMs are challenged by the extreme heterogeneity of graph data, where each graph can possess a unique feature space, label set, and topology. To address this, two main paradigms have emerged. The first leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), but is fundamentally text-dependent, thus struggles to handle the numerical features in vast graphs. The second pre-trains a structure-based model, but the adaptation to new tasks typically requires a costly, per-graph tuning stage, creating a critical efficiency bottleneck. In this work, we move beyond these limitations and introduce \textbf{G}raph \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{L}earning \textbf{T}ransformer (GILT), a framework built on an LLM-free and tuning-free architecture. GILT introduces a novel token-based framework for in-context learning (ICL) on graphs, reframing classification tasks spanning node, edge and graph levels in a unified framework. This mechanism is the key to handling heterogeneity, as it is designed to operate on generic numerical features. Further, its ability to understand class semantics dynamically from the context enables tuning-free adaptation. Comprehensive experiments show that GILT achieves stronger few-shot performance with significantly less time than LLM-based or tuning-based baselines, validating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

We motivate the methodology through the classical correspondence of information theory with the physics of parabolic evolution equations. We integrate the fractional heat kernel into Graph Neural Network architectures such as Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention, enhancing their expressiveness through adaptive, multi-hop diffusion. By applying Chebyshev polynomial approximations, large graphs become computationally feasible. Motivating variational formulations demonstrate that by extending the classical diffusion model to fractional powers of the Laplacian, nonlocal interactions deliver more globally diffusing labels. The particular balance between supervision of known labels and diffusion across the graph is particularly advantageous in the case where only a small number of labeled training examples are present. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on standard datasets.</p></details> |  |

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are effective but computationally expensive, thus inspiring the development of surrogate models to enable quicker predictions. These surrogate models can be based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Diffusion models have shown significant promise in predicting complex flow fields. In this work, we propose FoilDiff, a diffusion-based surrogate model with a hybrid-backbone denoising network. This hybrid design combines the power of convolutional feature extraction and transformer-based global attention to generate more adaptable and accurate representations of flow structures. FoilDiff takes advantage of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling to optimise the efficiency of the sampling process at no additional cost to model generalisation. We used encoded representations of Reynolds number, angle of attack, and airfoil geometry to define the input space for generalisation across a wide range of aerodynamic conditions. When evaluated against state-of-the-art models, FoilDiff shows significant performance improvements, with mean prediction errors reducing by up to 85\% on the same datasets. The results have demonstrated that FoilDiff can provide both more accurate predictions and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty than existing diffusion-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid GNN-IZR Framework for Fast and Empirically Robust AC Power Flow Analysis in Radial Distribution Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04264v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Alternating Current Power Flow (ACPF) problem forces a trade-off between the speed of data-driven models and the reliability of analytical solvers. This paper introduces a hybrid framework that synergizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with the Implicit Z-Bus Recursive (IZR) method, a robust, non-iterative solver for radial distribution networks. The framework employs a physics-informed GNN for rapid initial predictions and invokes the IZR solver as a failsafe for stressed cases identified by a two-stage trigger. A failure is defined as any solution with a maximum power mismatch exceeding 0.1 p.u., a significant operational deviation. On a challenging test set of 7,500 stressed scenarios for the IEEE 33-bus system, the GNN-only model failed on 13.11 % of cases. In contrast, the hybrid framework identified all potential failures, delegating them to the IZR solver to achieve a 0.00 % failure rate, empirically matching the 100 % success rate of the analytical solver on this specific test set. An expanded ablation study confirms that both physics-informed training and Z-bus sensitivity features are critical, collaboratively reducing the GNN's failure rate from 98.72 % (data-only) to 13.11 %. The hybrid approach demonstrates a pragmatic path to achieving the empirical reliability of an analytical solver while leveraging GNN speed, enabling a significant increase in the number of scenarios analyzable in near real-time.</p></details> |  |

However, distilling GNNs for self-supervised graph representation learning into MLPs is more challenging. This is because the performance of self-supervised learning is more related to the model's inductive bias than supervised learning. This motivates us to design a new distillation method to bridge a huge capacity gap between GNNs and MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{D}iffusion-\textbf{A}ssisted \textbf{D}istillation for \textbf{S}elf-supervised \textbf{G}raph representation learning with \textbf{M}LPs (DAD-SGM). The proposed method employs a denoising diffusion model as a teacher assistant to better distill the knowledge from the teacher GNN into the student MLP. This approach enhances the generalizability and robustness of MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAD-SGM effectively distills the knowledge of self-supervised GNNs compared to state-of-the-art GNN-to-MLP distillation methods.

Previous works have addressed this problem either through classical planning methods or by learning state-based policies. They assume access to reliable state information, such as the precise object poses and environment models. In this work, we study base pose planning directly from top-down orthographic projections of the scene, which provide a global overview of the scene while preserving spatial structure. We propose VBM-NET, a learning-based method for base pose selection using such top-down orthographic projections. We use equivariant TransporterNet to exploit spatial symmetries and efficiently learn candidate base poses for grasping. Further, we use graph neural networks to represent a varying number of candidate base poses and use Reinforcement Learning to determine the optimal base pose among them. We show that VBM-NET can produce comparable solutions to the classical methods in significantly less computation time. Furthermore, we validate sim-to-real transfer by successfully deploying a policy trained in simulation to real-world mobile manipulation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |

While numerous innovative methods have been proposed to design cluster assignments and coarsening strategies, the relationships between clusters are often overlooked. In this paper, we introduce Inter-cluster Connectivity Enhancement Pooling (ICEPool), a novel hierarchical pooling framework designed to enhance model's understanding of inter-cluster connectivity and ability of preserving the structural integrity in the original graph. ICEPool is compatible with a wide range of pooling-based GNN models. The deployment of ICEPool as an enhancement to existing models effectively combines the strengths of the original model with ICEPool's capability to emphasize the integration of inter-cluster connectivity, resulting in a more comprehensive and robust graph-level representation. Moreover, we make theoretical analysis to ICEPool's ability of graph reconstruction to demonstrate its effectiveness in learning inter-cluster relationship that is overlooked by conventional models. Finally, the experimental results show the compatibility of ICEPool with wide varieties of models and its potential to boost the performance of existing graph neural network architectures.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a rigorous convergence analysis of GNDEs with time-varying parameters in the infinite-node limit, providing theoretical insights into their size transferability. To this end, we introduce Graphon Neural Differential Equations (Graphon-NDEs) as the infinite-node limit of GNDEs and establish their well-posedness. Leveraging tools from graphon theory and dynamical systems, we prove the trajectory-wise convergence of GNDE solutions to Graphon-NDE solutions. Moreover, we derive explicit convergence rates under two deterministic graph sampling regimes: (1) weighted graphs sampled from smooth graphons, and (2) unweighted graphs sampled from $\{0,1\}$-valued (discontinuous) graphons. We further establish size transferability bounds, providing theoretical justification for the practical strategy of transferring GNDE models trained on moderate-sized graphs to larger, structurally similar graphs without retraining. Numerical experiments using synthetic and real data support our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |

They have been used to eliminate issues such as over-smoothing or over-squashing, to significantly enhance the accuracy of GNN predictions, to improve the expressiveness of GNN architectures, and for numerous other goals. A plethora of HOGNN models have been introduced, and they come with diverse neural architectures, and even with different notions of what the "higher-order" means. This richness makes it very challenging to appropriately analyze and compare HOGNN models, and to decide in what scenario to use specific ones. To alleviate this, we first design an in-depth taxonomy and a blueprint for HOGNNs. This facilitates designing models that maximize performance. Then, we use our taxonomy to analyze and compare the available HOGNN models. The outcomes of our analysis are synthesized in a set of insights that help to select the most beneficial GNN model in a given scenario, and a comprehensive list of challenges and opportunities for further research into more powerful HOGNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Generation Powered with LLMs for Boosting Multivariate Time-Series Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03645v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sourced from multiple sensors and organized chronologically, Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) data involves crucial spatial-temporal dependencies. To capture these dependencies, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools. As explicit graphs are not inherent to MTS data, graph generation becomes a critical first step in adapting GNNs to this domain. However, existing approaches often rely solely on the data itself for MTS graph generation, leaving them vulnerable to biases from small training datasets. This limitation hampers their ability to construct effective graphs, undermining the accurate modeling of underlying dependencies in MTS data and reducing GNN performance in this field. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, K-Link, leveraging the extensive universal knowledge encoded in Large Language Models (LLMs) to reduce biases for powered MTS graph generation. To harness the knowledge within LLMs, such as physical principles, we design and extract a \textit{Knowledge-Link graph} that captures universal knowledge of sensors and their linkage. To empower MTS graph generation with the knowledge-link graph, we further introduce a graph alignment module that transfers universal knowledge from the knowledge-link graph to the graph generated from MTS data. This enhances the MTS graph quality, ensuring effective representation learning for MTS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of K-Link for superior performance on various MTS tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization of Graph Neural Network Models for Distribution Grid Fault Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03571v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault detection in power distribution grids is critical for ensuring system reliability and preventing costly outages. Moreover, fault detection methodologies should remain robust to evolving grid topologies caused by factors such as reconfigurations, equipment failures, and Distributed Energy Resource (DER) integration. Current data-driven state-of-the-art methods use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for temporal modeling and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for spatial learning, in an RNN+GNN pipeline setting (RGNN in short). Specifically, for power system fault diagnosis, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been adopted. Yet, various more advanced GNN architectures have been proposed and adopted in domains outside of power systems. In this paper, we set out to systematically and consistently benchmark various GNN architectures in an RNN+GNN pipeline model. Specifically, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to (i) propose to use GraphSAGE and Graph Attention (GAT, GATv2) in an RGNN for fault diagnosis, and (ii) provide a comprehensive benchmark against earlier proposed RGNN solutions (RGCN) as well as pure RNN models (especially Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)), particularly (iii) exploring their generalization potential for deployment in different settings than those used for training them. Our experimental results on the IEEE 123-node distribution network show that RGATv2 has superior generalization capabilities, maintaining high performance with an F1-score reduction of $\sim$12% across different topology settings. In contrast, pure RNN models largely fail, experiencing an F1-score reduction of up to $\sim$60%, while other RGNN variants also exhibit significant performance degradation, i.e., up to $\sim$25% lower F1-scores.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted and accepted for IEEE SmartGridComm 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Node Feature Selection For Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03096v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an adaptive node feature selection approach for graph neural networks (GNNs) that identifies and removes unnecessary features during training. The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key for interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving performance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data introduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature importance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on changes in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We theoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how GNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph structure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training concludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively dropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and also evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify the flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its adaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrap Learning for Combinatorial Graph Alignment with Sequential GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03086v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have struggled to outperform traditional optimization methods on combinatorial problems, limiting their practical impact. We address this gap by introducing a novel chaining procedure for the graph alignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard task of finding optimal node correspondences between unlabeled graphs using only structural information. Our method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference, this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 10 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Recently, machine learning classifiers based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model against nine established brain network classification methods across three multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore, the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance for real-world diagnostic applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted by Biomedical Signal Processing and Control and the code is available at https://github.com/TianzhengHU/BrainIB_coding/tree/main/BrainIB_GIB</p></details> |

Topology control is an appealing method for relieving congestion, but traditional approaches for topology discovery have proven too slow for practical application. Recent research has focused on machine learning (ML) as an efficient alternative. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are particularly well-suited for topology control applications due to their ability to model the graph structure of power grids. This study investigates the effect of the graph representation on GNN effectiveness for topology control. We identify the busbar information asymmetry problem inherent to the popular homogeneous graph representation. We propose a heterogeneous graph representation that resolves this problem. We apply GNNs with both representations and a fully connected neural network (FCNN) baseline on an imitation learning task. The models are evaluated by classification accuracy and grid operation ability. We find that heterogeneous GNNs perform best on in-distribution network configurations, followed by FCNNs, and lastly, homogeneous GNNs. We also find that both GNN types generalize better to out-of-distribution network configurations than FCNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Towards Quantifying Long-Range Interactions in Graph Machine Learning: a Large Graph Dataset and a Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09008v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-range dependencies are critical for effective graph representation learning, yet most existing datasets focus on small graphs tailored to inductive tasks, offering limited insight into long-range interactions. Current evaluations primarily compare models employing global attention (e.g., graph transformers) with those using local neighborhood aggregation (e.g., message-passing neural networks) without a direct measurement of long-range dependency. In this work, we introduce City-Networks, a novel large-scale transductive learning dataset derived from real-world city road networks. This dataset features graphs with over 100k nodes and significantly larger diameters than those in existing benchmarks, naturally embodying long-range information. We annotate the graphs based on local node eccentricities, ensuring that the classification task inherently requires information from distant nodes. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic measurement based on the Jacobians of neighbors from distant hops, offering a principled quantification of long-range dependencies. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications for both our dataset design and the proposed measurement-particularly by focusing on over-smoothing and influence score dilution-which establishes a robust foundation for further exploration of long-range interactions in graph neural networks.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[VisitHGNN: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Modeling Point-of-Interest Visit Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02702v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how urban residents travel between neighborhoods and destinations is critical for transportation planning, mobility management, and public health. By mining historical origin-to-destination flow patterns with spatial, temporal, and functional relations among urban places, we estimate probabilities of visits from neighborhoods to specific destinations. These probabilities capture neighborhood-level contributions to citywide vehicular and foot traffic, supporting demand estimation, accessibility assessment, and multimodal planning. Particularly, we introduce VisitHGNN, a heterogeneous, relation-specific graph neural network designed to predict visit probabilities at individual Points of interest (POIs). POIs are characterized using numerical, JSON-derived, and textual attributes, augmented with fixed summaries of POI--POI spatial proximity, temporal co-activity, and brand affinity, while census block groups (CBGs) are described with 72 socio-demographic variables. CBGs are connected via spatial adjacency, and POIs and CBGs are linked through distance-annotated cross-type edges. Inference is constrained to a distance-based candidate set of plausible origin CBGs, and training minimizes a masked Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to yield probability distribution across the candidate set. Using weekly mobility data from Fulton County, Georgia, USA, VisitHGNN achieves strong predictive performance with mean KL divergence of 0.287, MAE of 0.008, Top-1 accuracy of 0.853, and R-square of 0.892, substantially outperforming pairwise MLP and distance-only baselines, and aligning closely with empirical visitation patterns (NDCG@50 = 0.966); Recall@5 = 0.611). The resulting distributions closely mirror observed travel behavior with high fidelity, highlighting the model's potential for decision support in urban planning, transportation policy, mobility system design, and public health.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Asymptomatic Nodes in Network Epidemics using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02568v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infected individuals in some epidemics can remain asymptomatic while still carrying and transmitting the infection. These individuals contribute to the spread of the epidemic and pose a significant challenge to public health policies. Identifying asymptomatic individuals is critical for measuring and controlling an epidemic, but periodic and widespread testing of healthy individuals is often too costly. This work tackles the problem of identifying asymptomatic individuals considering a classic SI (Susceptible-Infected) network epidemic model where a fraction of the infected nodes are not observed as infected (i.e., their observed state is identical to susceptible nodes). In order to classify healthy nodes as asymptomatic or susceptible, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model with supervised learning is adopted where a set of node features are built from the network with observed infected nodes. The approach is evaluated across different network models, network sizes, and fraction of observed infections. Results indicate that the proposed methodology is robust across different scenarios, accurately identifying asymptomatic nodes while also generalizing to different network sizes and fraction of observed infections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper presented in the 35th Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems (BRACIS)</p></details> |
| **[On The Expressive Power of GNN Derivatives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02565v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their limited expressivity remains a fundamental challenge. Research on GNN expressivity has produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN (HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture. Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism. Evaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong performance on popular graph learning tasks.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provides a powerful lens into large-scale functional connectivity, where brain regions are modeled as nodes and inter-regional synchrony as edges, offering clinically relevant biomarkers for psychiatric disorders. While prior works use graph neural network (GNN) approaches for disorder prediction, they remain complex black-boxes, limiting their reliability and clinical translation. In this work, we propose CONCEPTNEURO, a concept-based diagnosis framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and neurobiological domain knowledge to automatically generate, filter, and encode interpretable functional connectivity concepts. Each concept is represented as a structured subgraph linking specific brain regions, which are then passed through a concept classifier. Our design ensures predictions through clinically meaningful connectivity patterns, enabling both interpretability and strong predictive performance. Extensive experiments across multiple psychiatric disorder datasets demonstrate that CONCEPTNEURO-augmented GNNs consistently outperform their vanilla counterparts, improving accuracy while providing transparent, clinically aligned explanations. Furthermore, concept analyses highlight disorder-specific connectivity patterns that align with expert knowledge and suggest new hypotheses for future investigation, establishing CONCEPTNEURO as an interpretable, domain-informed framework for psychiatric disorder diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Representation of Stiffened Panels with Non-Uniform Boundary Conditions and Loads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02472v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surrogate models are essential in structural analysis and optimization. We propose a heterogeneous graph representation of stiffened panels that accounts for geometrical variability, non-uniform boundary conditions, and diverse loading scenarios, using heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The structure is partitioned into multiple structural units, such as stiffeners and the plates between them, with each unit represented by three distinct node types: geometry, boundary, and loading nodes. Edge heterogeneity is introduced by incorporating local orientations and spatial relationships of the connecting nodes. Several heterogeneous graph representations, each with varying degrees of heterogeneity, are proposed and analyzed. These representations are implemented into a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) to predict von Mises stress and displacement fields across stiffened panels, based on loading and degrees of freedom at their boundaries. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we conducted numerical tests on panels subjected to patch loads and box beams composed of stiffened panels under various loading conditions. The heterogeneous graph representation was compared with a homogeneous counterpart, demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, an ablation analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of graph heterogeneity on HGT performance. The results show strong predictive accuracy for both displacement and von Mises stress, effectively capturing structural behavior patterns and maximum values.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint and has been submitted to Engineering with Computers</p></details> |

The proper evaluation of traffic forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformers Discover Molecular Structure Without Graph Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02259v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25 dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures for molecular modeling.</p></details> |  |

The problem is challenging in decentralized settings with robots that have limited communication and sensing capabilities. We propose a learnable Perception-Action-Communication (LPAC) architecture for the problem, wherein a convolutional neural network (CNN) processes localized perception; a graph neural network (GNN) facilitates robot communications; finally, a shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) computes robot actions. The GNN enables collaboration in the robot swarm by computing what information to communicate with nearby robots and how to incorporate received information. Evaluations show that the LPAC models -- trained using imitation learning -- outperform standard decentralized and centralized coverage control algorithms. The learned policy generalizes to environments different from the training dataset, transfers to larger environments with more robots, and is robust to noisy position estimates. The results indicate the suitability of LPAC architectures for decentralized navigation in robot swarms to achieve collaborative behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 Pa...</summary><p>20 Pages, 20 figures, Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

Multi-level LLM Enhanced Graph Fraud Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11997v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph fraud detection has garnered significant attention as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in modeling complex relationships within multimodal data. However, existing graph fraud detection methods typically use preprocessed node embeddings and predefined graph structures to reveal fraudsters, which ignore the rich semantic cues contained in raw textual information. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful capabilities in processing textual information, it remains a significant challenge to perform multimodal fusion of processed textual embeddings with graph structures. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{M}ulti-level \textbf{L}LM \textbf{E}nhanced Graph Fraud \textbf{D}etection framework called MLED. In MLED, we utilize LLMs to extract external knowledge from textual information to enhance graph fraud detection methods. To integrate LLMs with graph structure information and enhance the ability to distinguish fraudsters, we design a multi-level LLM enhanced framework including type-level enhancer and relation-level enhancer. One is to enhance the difference between the fraudsters and the benign entities, the other is to enhance the importance of the fraudsters in different relations. The experiments on four real-world datasets show that MLED achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph fraud detection as a generalized framework that can be applied to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

Rethinking Robust Graph Learning under Deficiencies with Iterative Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01910v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in Web-related applications, serving as a core technique for learning from graph-structured data, such as text-attributed graphs. Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies, revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement (RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent, diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.</p></details> | 14 pages |

These reviews pose significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets, a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era.

Recently, adopting LLMs in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) has drawn increasing attention. However, the adoption of LLMs faces two major challenges: limited information on graph structure and unreliable responses. LLMs struggle with text attributes isolated from the graph topology. Worse still, they yield unreliable predictions due to both information insufficiency and the inherent weakness of LLMs (e.g., hallucination). Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel method named Dynamic Text Bundling Supervision (DENSE) that queries LLMs with bundles of texts to obtain bundle-level labels and uses these labels to supervise graph neural networks. Specifically, we sample a set of bundles, each containing a set of nodes with corresponding texts of close proximity. We then query LLMs with the bundled texts to obtain the label of each bundle. Subsequently, the bundle labels are used to supervise the optimization of graph neural networks, and the bundles are further refined to exclude noisy items. To justify our design, we also provide theoretical analysis of the proposed method. Extensive experiments across ten datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Recent advances, especially graph neural networks (GNNs)-based methods, have significantly improved clustering performance. However, the analysis of scRNA-seq data remains challenging due to noise, sparsity, and high dimensionality. Compounding these challenges, GNNs often suffer from over-smoothing, limiting their ability to capture complex biological information. In response, we propose scSiameseClu, a novel Siamese Clustering framework for interpreting single-cell RNA-seq data, comprising of 3 key steps: (1) Dual Augmentation Module, which applies biologically informed perturbations to the gene expression matrix and cell graph relationships to enhance representation robustness; (2) Siamese Fusion Module, which combines cross-correlation refinement and adaptive information fusion to capture complex cellular relationships while mitigating over-smoothing; and (3) Optimal Transport Clustering, which utilizes Sinkhorn distance to efficiently align cluster assignments with predefined proportions while maintaining balance. Comprehensive evaluations on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that scSiameseClu outperforms state-of-the-art methods in single-cell clustering, cell type annotation, and cell type classification, providing a powerful tool for scRNA-seq data interpretation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a novel method that leverages causal dynamics to achieve effective fMRI-based subject and task fingerprinting. Methods: By applying an implicit-explicit discretization scheme, we develop a two-timescale linear state-space model. Through data-driven identification of its parameters, the model captures causal signatures, including directed interactions among brain regions from a spatial perspective, and disentangled fast and slow dynamic modes of brain activity from a temporal perspective. These causal signatures are then integrated with: (i) a modal decomposition and projection method for model-based subject identification, and (ii) a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for learning-based task classification. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of the brain reachability landscape as a novel visualization tool, which quantitatively characterizes the maximum possible activation levels of brain regions under various fMRI tasks. Results: We evaluate the proposed approach using the Human Connectome Project dataset and demonstrate its advantage over non-causality-based methods. The obtained causal signatures are visualized and demonstrate clear biological relevance with established understandings of brain function. Conclusion: We verified the feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing brain causal signatures for subject and task fingerprinting. Additionally, our work paves the way for further studies on causal fingerprints with potential applications in both healthy controls and neurodegenerative diseases.</p></details> |  |

Integrating physical laws with graph neural networks facilitates principled modeling of complex N-body dynamics and yields accurate and permutation-invariant models. However, training graph neural networks with iterative, gradient-based optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSProp, LBFGS) often leads to slow training, especially for large, complex systems. In comparison to 15 different optimizers, we demonstrate that Hamiltonian Graph Networks (HGN) can be trained up to 600x faster--but with comparable accuracy--by replacing iterative optimization with random feature-based parameter construction. We show robust performance in diverse simulations, including N-body mass-spring and molecular systems in up to 3 dimensions and 10,000 particles with different geometries, while retaining essential physical invariances with respect to permutation, rotation, and translation. Our proposed approach is benchmarked using a NeurIPS 2022 Datasets and Benchmarks Track publication to further demonstrate its versatility. We reveal that even when trained on minimal 8-node systems, the model can generalize in a zero-shot manner to systems as large as 4096 nodes without retraining. Our work challenges the dominance of iterative gradient-descent-based optimization algorithms for training neural network models for physical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, and an appendix</p></details> |

Yet, standard message passing neural networks (MPNNs) face well-documented theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encoding (PE) has emerged as a promising direction to address these limitations. The Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently computable geometric-topological invariant that characterizes shapes and graphs. In this work, we combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) and its local variant ($\ell$-ECT) to propose LEAP, a new end-to-end trainable local structural PE for graphs. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world datasets as well as on a synthetic task designed to test its ability to extract topological features. Our results underline the potential of LEAP-based encodings as a powerful component for graph representation learning pipelines.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often struggle with architecture-specific limitations, data scarcity, and diverse naming conventions. We present AGNOMIN, a novel architecture-agnostic approach for multi-label function name prediction in stripped binaries. AGNOMIN builds Feature-Enriched Hierarchical Graphs (FEHGs), combining Control Flow Graphs, Function Call Graphs, and dynamically learned \texttt{PCode} features. A hierarchical graph neural network processes this enriched structure to generate consistent function representations across architectures, vital for \textbf{scalable security assessments}. For function name prediction, AGNOMIN employs a Ren\'ee-inspired decoder, enhanced with an attention-based head layer and algorithmic improvements. We evaluate AGNOMIN on a comprehensive dataset of 9,000 ELF executable binaries across three architectures, demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with improvements of up to 27.17\% in precision and 55.86\% in recall across the testing dataset. Moreover, AGNOMIN generalizes well to unseen architectures, achieving 5.89\% higher recall than the closest baseline. AGNOMIN's practical utility has been validated through security hackathons, where it successfully aided reverse engineers in analyzing and patching vulnerable binaries across different architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchy-Aware Neural Subgraph Matching with Enhanced Similarity Measure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00402v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subgraph matching is challenging as it necessitates time-consuming combinatorial searches. Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches address this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and hinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding space. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them promising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale differences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature counts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted subtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions. Additionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for matched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications. We propose NC-Iso, a novel GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching. NC-Iso preserves the relative positions of features by building the hierarchical dependencies between adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graph pairs maintain consistent hierarchies while complying with containment constraints in feature counts. To enhance the ranking ability for matched pairs, we introduce a novel similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure, which quantifies the dominance of similarity over dissimilarity between graph pairs. Empirical results on nine datasets validate the effectiveness, generalization ability, scalability, and transferability of NC-Iso while maintaining time efficiency, offering a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution for subgraph retrieval.

While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model (RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet. Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.</p></details> |  |

Despite the availability of diverse search-based and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge, algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system, MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters, offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third, rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200 protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Short paper.

We introduce a novel risk-aggregated formulation of the complex WSR maximization problem, which utilizes the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as a functional for enforcing rate (ultra)-reliability over channel fading uncertainty/risk. We establish a WMMSE-like equivalence between the proposed precoding problem and a weighted risk-averse MSE problem, enabling us to design a tailored unfolded graph neural network (GNN) policy function approximation (PFA), named {\alpha}-Robust Graph Neural Network ({\alpha}RGNN), trained to maximize lower-tail (CVaR) rates resulting from adverse wireless channel realizations (e.g., deep fading, attenuation). We empirically demonstrate that a trained {\alpha}RGNN fully eliminates per user deep rate fades, and substantially and optimally reduces statistical user rate variability while retaining adequate ergodic performance.</p></details> |  |

Despite its potential, traditional clustering methods in scRNA-seq data analysis often neglect the structural information embedded in gene expression profiles, crucial for understanding cellular correlations and dependencies. Existing strategies, including graph neural networks, face challenges in handling the inefficiency due to scRNA-seq data's intrinsic high-dimension and high-sparsity. Addressing these limitations, we introduce scCDCG (single-cell RNA-seq Clustering via Deep Cut-informed Graph), a novel framework designed for efficient and accurate clustering of scRNA-seq data that simultaneously utilizes intercellular high-order structural information. scCDCG comprises three main components: (i) A graph embedding module utilizing deep cut-informed techniques, which effectively captures intercellular high-order structural information, overcoming the over-smoothing and inefficiency issues prevalent in prior graph neural network methods. (ii) A self-supervised learning module guided by optimal transport, tailored to accommodate the unique complexities of scRNA-seq data, specifically its high-dimension and high-sparsity. (iii) An autoencoder-based feature learning module that simplifies model complexity through effective dimension reduction and feature extraction. Our extensive experiments on 6 datasets demonstrate scCDCG's superior performance and efficiency compared to 7 established models, underscoring scCDCG's potential as a transformative tool in scRNA-seq data analysis.

| **[Stealthy Yet Effective: Distribution-Preserving Backdoor Attacks on Graph Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26032v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework DGL to analyze and forecast industrial CO_2 emissions, addressing high feature correlation and capturing industrial-temporal interdependencies. Unlike traditional regression or clustering methods, our approach leverages a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with attention mechanisms to model relationships between industries (or regions) and a temporal transformer to learn long-range patterns. We evaluate our framework on public global industry emissions dataset derived from EDGAR v8.0, spanning multiple countries and sectors. The proposed model achieves superior predictive performance - reducing error by over 15% compared to baseline deep models - while maintaining interpretability via attention weights and causal analysis. We believe that we are the first Graph-Temporal architecture that resolves multicollinearity by structurally encoding feature relationships, along with integration of causal inference to identify true drivers of emissions, improving transparency and fairness. We also stand a demonstration of policy relevance, showing how model insights can guide sector-specific decarbonization strategies aligned with sustainable development goals. Based on the above, we show high-emission "hotspots" and suggest equitable intervention plans, illustrating the potential of state-of-the-art AI graph learning to advance climate action, offering a powerful tool for policymakers and industry stakeholders to achieve carbon reduction targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 AI for Science Workshop</p></details> |

However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods utilize graph neural networks to model user intention in a unified manner, which inadequately considers the heterogeneity across different behaviors. Especially, high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors may implicitly contain noisy signals, and frequent patterns that are plausible while misleading, thereby hindering the learning of user intentions. To this end, this paper proposes a novel multi-behavior recommendation method, HiFIRec, that corrects the effect of high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors by differential behavior modeling. To revise the noisy signals, we hierarchically suppress it across layers by extracting neighborhood information through layer-wise neighborhood aggregation and further capturing user intentions through adaptive cross-layer feature fusion. To correct plausible frequent patterns, we propose an intensity-aware non-sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the weights of negative samples. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show that HiFIRec relatively improves HR@10 by 4.21%-6.81% over several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL) framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN) algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures and 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Graph Coarsening for Efficient GNN Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25706v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an adaptive graph coarsening method to jointly learn graph neural network (GNN) parameters and merge nodes via K-means clustering during training. As real-world graphs grow larger, processing them directly becomes increasingly challenging and sometimes infeasible. Tailoring algorithms to large-scale data may sacrifice performance, so we instead consider graph reduction to decrease the amount of data used during training. In particular, we propose a method to simultaneously train a GNN and coarsen its graph by partitioning nodes via K-means clustering based on their embeddings. Unlike past graph coarsening works, our approach allows us to merge nodes during training. Not only does this preclude coarsening as a preprocessing step, but our node clusters can adapt to the learning task instead of relying solely on graph connectivity and features. Thus, our method is amenable to scenarios that are challenging for other methods, such as heterophilic data. We validate our approach on both homophilic and heterophilic node classification datasets. We further visualize relationships between node embeddings and their corresponding clusters to illustrate that our coarsened graph adapts to the learning task during training.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoREX: Towards Self-Explainable Social Recommendation with Relevant Ego-Path Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00080v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social recommendation has been proven effective in addressing data sparsity in user-item interaction modeling by leveraging social networks. The recent integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has further enhanced prediction accuracy in contemporary social recommendation algorithms. However, many GNN-based approaches in social recommendation lack the ability to furnish meaningful explanations for their predictions. In this study, we confront this challenge by introducing SoREX, a self-explanatory GNN-based social recommendation framework. SoREX adopts a two-tower framework enhanced by friend recommendation, independently modeling social relations and user-item interactions, while jointly optimizing an auxiliary task to reinforce social signals. To offer explanations, we propose a novel ego-path extraction approach. This method involves transforming the ego-net of a target user into a collection of multi-hop ego-paths, from which we extract factor-specific and candidate-aware ego-path subsets as explanations. This process facilitates the summarization of detailed comparative explanations among different candidate items through intricate substructure analysis. Furthermore, we conduct explanation re-aggregation to explicitly correlate explanations with downstream predictions, imbuing our framework with inherent self-explainability. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four widely adopted benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of SoREX in predictive accuracy. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative analyses confirm the efficacy of the extracted explanations in SoREX.

An essential part of the ViG framework is the node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to prior vision GNN architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV submission. 13 pages, including the main text (8 pages), references, and supplementary material</p></details> |

Despite their promise and impressive results across the natural sciences, scaling these models to large systems remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann Generator architecture that addresses this scalability bottleneck with a focus on applications in materials science. We leverage augmented coupling flows in combination with graph neural networks to base the generation process on local environmental information, while allowing for energy-based training and fast inference. Compared to previous architectures, our model trains significantly faster, requires far less computational resources, and achieves superior sampling efficiencies. Crucially, the architecture is transferable to larger system sizes, which allows for the efficient sampling of materials with simulation cells of unprecedented size. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying it to several materials systems, including Lennard-Jones crystals, ice phases of mW water, and the phase diagram of silicon, for system sizes well above one thousand atoms. The trained Boltzmann Generators produce highly accurate equilibrium ensembles for various crystal structures, as well as Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies across a range of system sizes, able to reach scales where finite-size effects become negligible.</p></details> |  |

Current state-of-the-art approaches suffer from semantic inflexibility, persistent demographic bias, opacity in decision-making processes, and poor scalability under dynamic policy constraints. We present GESA (Graph-Enhanced Semantic Allocation), a comprehensive framework that addresses these limitations through the integration of domain-adaptive transformer embeddings, heterogeneous self-supervised graph neural networks, adversarial debiasing mechanisms, multi-objective genetic optimization, and explainable AI components. Our experimental evaluation on large-scale international benchmarks comprising 20,000 candidate profiles and 3,000 role specifications demonstrates superior performance with 94.5% top-3 allocation accuracy, 37% improvement in diversity representation, 0.98 fairness score across demographic categories, and sub-second end-to-end latency.

| **[Leveraging Vulnerabilities in Temporal Graph Neural Networks via Strategic High-Impact Assaults](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25418v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have become indispensable for analyzing dynamic graphs in critical applications such as social networks, communication systems, and financial networks. However, the robustness of TGNNs against adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit the temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack methods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic, easily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and fail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum impact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box attack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose critical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model to identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and dynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It then employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection (to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt essential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA minimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more challenging to detect. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets and four representative TGNN architectures (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, and TGAT) demonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction task, achieving up to a 35.55% decrease in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in current STDG models and underscore the urgent need for robust defenses that account for both structural and temporal dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Machine learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer significant speedups but suffer from poor generalization when trained on limited or incomplete data. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of inductive biases in improving a model's ability to reliably learn power flow. Specifically, we evaluate three physics-informed strategies: (i) power-flow-constrained loss functions, (ii) complex-valued neural networks, and (iii) residual-based task reformulation. Using the ENGAGE dataset, which spans multiple low- and medium-voltage grid configurations, we conduct controlled experiments to isolate the effect of each inductive bias and assess both standard predictive performance and out-of-distribution generalization. Our study provides practical insights into which model assumptions most effectively guide learning for reliable and efficient voltage prediction in modern distribution networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Dynamic Image Graph Construction on FPGA for Vision GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25121v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Graph Neural Networks (Vision GNNs, or ViGs) represent images as unstructured graphs, achieving state of the art performance in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. Dynamic Image Graph Construction (DIGC) builds image graphs by connecting patches (nodes) based on feature similarity, and is dynamically repeated in each ViG layer following GNN based patch (node) feature updates. However, DIGC constitutes over 50% of end to end ViG inference latency, rising to 95% at high image resolutions, making it the dominant computational bottleneck. While hardware acceleration holds promise, prior works primarily optimize graph construction algorithmically, often compromising DIGC flexibility, accuracy, or generality. To address these limitations, we propose a streaming, deeply pipelined FPGA accelerator for DIGC, featuring on chip buffers that process input features in small, uniform blocks. Our design minimizes external memory traffic via localized computation and performs efficient parallel sorting with local merge sort and global k way merging directly on streaming input blocks via heap insertion. This modular architecture scales seamlessly across image resolutions, ViG layer types, and model sizes and variants, and supports DIGC across diverse ViG based vision backbones. The design achieves high clock frequencies post place and route due to the statically configured parallelism minimizing critical path delay and delivers up to 16.6x and 6.8x speedups over optimized CPU and GPU DIGC baselines.</p></details> | IEEE HPEC 2025 |

While machine learning approaches including those that are based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have achieved notable success in DTI prediction, many of them have difficulties in effectively integrating the diverse features of drugs, targets and their interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework to take advantage of the power of both transductive learning and inductive learning so that features at molecular level and drug-target interaction network level can be exploited. Within this framework is a GNN-based model called Graph-in-Graph (GiG) that represents graphs of drug and target molecular structures as meta-nodes in a drug-target interaction graph, enabling a detailed exploration of their intricate relationships. To evaluate the proposed model, we have compiled a special benchmark comprising drug SMILES, protein sequences, and their interaction data, which is interesting in its own right. Our experimental results demonstrate that the GiG model significantly outperforms existing approaches across all evaluation metrics, highlighting the benefits of integrating different learning paradigms and interaction data.</p></details> |  |

Many of these approaches are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) or related transformers, operating on the Euclidean coordinates representing the routing problems. However, such models are ill-suited for a wide range of real-world problems that feature non-Euclidean and asymmetric edge costs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel GNN-based and edge-focused neural model called Graph Edge Attention Network (GREAT). Using GREAT as an encoder to capture the properties of a routing problem instance, we build a reinforcement learning framework which we apply to both Euclidean and non-Euclidean variants of vehicle routing problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem, Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem and Orienteering Problem. Our framework is among the first to tackle non-Euclidean variants of these problems and achieves competitive results among learning-based benchmarks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

To enhance handover (HO) performance, 3GPP introduced Conditional Handover (CHO) and Layer 1/Layer 2 Triggered Mobility (LTM) mechanisms in 5G. While these reactive HO strategies address the trade-off between HO failures (HOF) and ping-pong effects, they often result in inefficient radio resource utilization due to additional HO preparations. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a proactive HO framework for mobility management in O-RAN, leveraging user-cell link predictions to identify the optimal target cell for HO. We explore various categories of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for link prediction and analyze the complexity of applying them to the mobility management domain. Two GNN models are compared using a real-world dataset, with experimental results demonstrating their ability to capture the dynamic and graph-structured nature of cellular networks. Finally, we present key insights from our study and outline future steps to enable the integration of GNN-based link prediction for mobility management in O-RAN networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table.

| **[Adaptive Canonicalization with Application to Invariant Anisotropic Geometric Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24886v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Canonicalization is a widely used strategy in equivariant machine learning, enforcing symmetry in neural networks by mapping each input to a standard form. Yet, it often introduces discontinuities that can affect stability during training, limit generalization, and complicate universal approximation theorems. In this paper, we address this by introducing \emph{adaptive canonicalization}, a general framework in which the canonicalization depends both on the input and the network. Specifically, we present the adaptive canonicalization based on prior maximization, where the standard form of the input is chosen to maximize the predictive confidence of the network. We prove that this construction yields continuous and symmetry-respecting models that admit universal approximation properties. We propose two applications of our setting: (i) resolving eigenbasis ambiguities in spectral graph neural networks, and (ii) handling rotational symmetries in point clouds. We empirically validate our methods on molecular and protein classification, as well as point cloud classification tasks. Our adaptive canonicalization outperforms the three other common solutions to equivariant machine learning: data augmentation, standard canonicalization, and equivariant architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[ELPG-DTFS: Prior-Guided Adaptive Time-Frequency Graph Neural Network for EEG Depression Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24860v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and objective screening of major depressive disorder (MDD) is vital, yet diagnosis still relies on subjective scales. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a low-cost biomarker, but existing deep models treat spectra as static images, fix inter-channel graphs, and ignore prior knowledge, limiting accuracy and interpretability. We propose ELPG-DTFS, a prior-guided adaptive time-frequency graph neural network that introduces: (1) channel-band attention with cross-band mutual information, (2) a learnable adjacency matrix for dynamic functional links, and (3) a residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting neuroscience priors. On the 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), ELPG-DTFS achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1, surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art ACM-GNN. Ablation shows that removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35, confirming their complementary value. ELPG-DTFS thus offers a robust and interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics.</p></details> | 8 page,3 figures |
| **[Beyond Softmax: A Natural Parameterization for Categorical Random Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24728v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent categorical variables are frequently found in deep learning architectures. They can model actions in discrete reinforcement-learning environments, represent categories in latent-variable models, or express relations in graph neural networks. Despite their widespread use, their discrete nature poses significant challenges to gradient-descent learning algorithms. While a substantial body of work has offered improved gradient estimation techniques, we take a complementary approach. Specifically, we: 1) revisit the ubiquitous $\textit{softmax}$ function and demonstrate its limitations from an information-geometric perspective; 2) replace the $\textit{softmax}$ with the $\textit{catnat}$ function, a function composed of a sequence of hierarchical binary splits; we prove that this choice offers significant advantages to gradient descent due to the resulting diagonal Fisher Information Matrix. A rich set of experiments - including graph structure learning, variational autoencoders, and reinforcement learning - empirically show that the proposed function improves the learning efficiency and yields models characterized by consistently higher test performance. $\textit{Catnat}$ is simple to implement and seamlessly integrates into existing codebases. Moreover, it remains compatible with standard training stabilization techniques and, as such, offers a better alternative to the $\textit{softmax}$ function.</p></details> |  |
| **[Community detection robustness of graph neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24662v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly widely used for community detection in attributed networks. They combine structural topology with node attributes through message passing and pooling. However, their robustness or lack of thereof with respect to different perturbations and targeted attacks in conjunction with community detection tasks is not well understood. To shed light into latent mechanisms behind GNN sensitivity on community detection tasks, we conduct a systematic computational evaluation of six widely adopted GNN architectures: GCN, GAT, Graph-SAGE, DiffPool, MinCUT, and DMoN. The analysis covers three perturbation categories: node attribute manipulations, edge topology distortions, and adversarial attacks. We use element-centric similarity as the evaluation metric on synthetic benchmarks and real-world citation networks. Our findings indicate that supervised GNNs tend to achieve higher baseline accuracy, while unsupervised methods, particularly DMoN, maintain stronger resilience under targeted and adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, robustness appears to be strongly influenced by community strength, with well-defined communities reducing performance loss. Across all models, node attribute perturbations associated with targeted edge deletions and shift in attribute distributions tend to cause the largest degradation in community recovery. These findings highlight important trade-offs between accuracy and robustness in GNN-based community detection and offer new insights into selecting architectures resilient to noise and adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, the integration of AI-driven robotic laboratories and high-throughput computing has established a fully automated pipeline for rapid synthesis and experimental validation, drastically reducing the time and cost of material discovery. This review highlights real-world applications of automated ML-driven approaches in predicting mechanical, thermal, electrical, and optical properties of materials, demonstrating successful cases in superconductors, catalysts, photovoltaics, and energy storage systems. We also address key challenges, such as data quality, interpretability, and the integration of AutoML with quantum computing, which are essential for future advancements. Ultimately, combining AI with automated experimentation and computational modeling is transforming the way materials are discovered and optimized.

| **[Prompting Robot Teams with Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24575v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a framework towards prompting multi-robot teams with high-level tasks using natural language expressions. Our objective is to use the reasoning capabilities demonstrated by recent language models in understanding and decomposing human expressions of intent, and repurpose these for multi-robot collaboration and decision-making. The key challenge is that an individual's behavior in a collective can be hard to specify and interpret, and must continuously adapt to actions from others. This necessitates a framework that possesses the representational capacity required by the logic and semantics of a task, and yet supports decentralized and interactive real-time operation. We solve this dilemma by recognizing that a task can be represented as a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can encode numerous automata. This allows us to distill the logic and sequential decompositions of sub-tasks obtained from a language model into an RNN, and align its internal states with the semantics of a given task. By training a graph neural network (GNN) control policy that is conditioned on the hidden states of the RNN and the language embeddings, our method enables robots to execute task-relevant actions in a decentralized manner. We present evaluations of this single light-weight interpretable model on various simulated and real-world multi-robot tasks that require sequential and collaborative behavior by the team -- sites.google.com/view/prompting-teams.</p></details> |  |

This limitation arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight, adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Joint Conference on Knowledge Graphs</p></details> |
| **[Graph-Based Learning of Free Surface Dynamics in Generalized Newtonian Fluids using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24264v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we propose a graph neural network (GNN) model for efficiently predicting the flow behavior of non-Newtonian fluids with free surface dynamics. The numerical analysis of non-Newtonian fluids presents significant challenges, as traditional algorithms designed for Newtonian fluids with constant viscosity often struggle to converge when applied to non-Newtonian cases, where rheological properties vary dynamically with flow conditions. Among these, power-law fluids exhibit viscosity that decreases exponentially as the shear rate increases, making numerical simulations particularly difficult. The complexity further escalates in free surface flow scenarios, where computational challenges intensify. In such cases, particle-based methods like smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) provide advantages over traditional grid-based techniques, such as the finite element method (FEM). Building on this approach, we introduce a novel GNN-based numerical model to enhance the computational efficiency of non-Newtonian power-law fluid flow simulations. Our model is trained on SPH simulation data, learning the effects of particle accelerations in the presence of SPH interactions based on the fluid's power-law parameters. The GNN significantly accelerates computations while maintaining reliable accuracy in benchmark tests, including dam-break and droplet impact simulations. The results underscore the potential of GNN-based simulation frameworks for efficiently modeling non-Newtonian fluid behavior, paving the way for future advancements in data-driven fluid simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Difference-in-Differences Under Network Interference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24259v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops doubly robust estimators for direct (DATT) and spillover (SATT) average treatment effects on the treated in network-based difference-in-differences (DiD) designs. Unlike standard DiD methods, the proposed approach explicitly accommodates treatment spillovers and high-dimensional network confounding arising from complex inter-unit dependencies. Identification relies on a conditional parallel-trends assumption that holds after adjusting for high-dimensional network confounders. The estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal as the network size increases, and we use graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate nuisance functions. Simulation studies and an empirical application to U.S. county-level mask mandates and their impact on COVID-19 transmission demonstrate favorable finite-sample performance, addressing limitations of conventional DiD methods that ignore network interference.</p></details> |  |
| **[ADAPT: Lightweight, Long-Range Machine Learning Force Fields Without Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24115v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point defects play a central role in driving the properties of materials. First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases. However, these methods are computationally expensive, making machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) an attractive alternative for accelerating structural relaxations. Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 to...</summary><p>14 total pages of main content, 4 of references, 3 in Appendix</p></details> |

State-of-the-art models are generally graph neural networks that employ message passing to iteratively update atomic embeddings that are ultimately used for predicting properties. In this work we extend the message passing formalism with the inclusion of a continuous variable that accounts for fractional atomic existence. This allows us to calculate the gradient of the Gibbs free energy with respect to both the Cartesian coordinates of atoms and their existence. Using this we propose a gradient-based grand canonical optimization method and document its capabilities for a Cu(110) surface oxide.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00647v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sheaf diffusion has recently emerged as a promising design pattern for graph representation learning due to its inherent ability to handle heterophilic data and avoid oversmoothing. Meanwhile, cooperative message passing has also been proposed as a way to enhance the flexibility of information diffusion by allowing nodes to independently choose whether to propagate/gather information from/to neighbors. A natural question ensues: is sheaf diffusion capable of exhibiting this cooperative behavior? Here, we provide a negative answer to this question. In particular, we show that existing sheaf diffusion methods fail to achieve cooperative behavior due to the lack of message directionality. To circumvent this limitation, we introduce the notion of cellular sheaves over directed graphs and characterize their in- and out-degree Laplacians. We leverage our construction to propose Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks (CSNNs). Theoretically, we characterize the receptive field of CSNN and show it allows nodes to selectively attend (listen) to arbitrarily far nodes while ignoring all others in their path, potentially mitigating oversquashing. Our experiments show that CSNN presents overall better performance compared to prior art on sheaf diffusion as well as cooperative graph neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Neural Networks to Logical Theories: The Correspondence between Fibring Modal Logics and Fibring Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23912v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fibring of modal logics is a well-established formalism for combining countable families of modal logics into a single fibred language with common semantics, characterized by fibred models. Inspired by this formalism, fibring of neural networks was introduced as a neurosymbolic framework for combining learning and reasoning in neural networks. Fibring of neural networks uses the (pre-)activations of a trained network to evaluate a fibring function computing the weights of another network whose outputs are injected back into the original network. However, the exact correspondence between fibring of neural networks and fibring of modal logics was never formally established. In this paper, we close this gap by formalizing the idea of fibred models \emph{compatible} with fibred neural networks. Using this correspondence, we then derive non-uniform logical expressiveness results for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Transformer encoders. Longer-term, the goal of this paper is to open the way for the use of fibring as a formalism for interpreting the logical theories learnt by neural networks with the tools of computational logic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta Pruning via Graph Metanetworks : A Universal Meta Learning Framework for Network Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12041v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an entirely new meta-learning framework for network pruning. It is a general framework that can be theoretically applied to almost all types of networks with all kinds of pruning and has great generality and transferability. Experiments have shown that it can achieve outstanding results on many popular and representative pruning tasks (including both CNNs and Transformers). Unlike all prior works that either rely on fixed, hand-crafted criteria to prune in a coarse manner, or employ learning to prune ways that require special training during each pruning and lack generality. Our framework can learn complex pruning rules automatically via a neural network (metanetwork) and has great generality that can prune without any special training. More specifically, we introduce the newly developed idea of metanetwork from meta-learning into pruning. A metanetwork is a network that takes another network as input and produces a modified network as output. In this paper, we first establish a bijective mapping between neural networks and graphs, and then employ a graph neural network as our metanetwork. We train a metanetwork that learns the pruning strategy automatically and can transform a network that is hard to prune into another network that is much easier to prune. Once the metanetwork is trained, our pruning needs nothing more than a feedforward through the metanetwork and some standard finetuning to prune at state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yewei-Liu/MetaPruning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-time GNN Model Evaluation on Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23816v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a leading paradigm for learning from dynamic graphs, which are commonly used to model real-world systems and applications. However, due to the evolving nature of dynamic graph data distributions over time, well-trained DGNNs often face significant performance uncertainty when inferring on unseen and unlabeled test graphs in practical deployment. In this case, evaluating the performance of deployed DGNNs at test time is crucial to determine whether a well-trained DGNN is suited for inference on an unseen dynamic test graph. In this work, we introduce a new research problem: DGNN model evaluation, which aims to assess the performance of a specific DGNN model trained on observed dynamic graphs by estimating its performance on unseen dynamic graphs during test time. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Graph neural network Evaluator, dubbed DyGEval, to address this new problem. The proposed DyGEval involves a two-stage framework: (1) test-time dynamic graph simulation, which captures the training-test distributional differences as supervision signals and trains an evaluator; and (2) DyGEval development and training, which accurately estimates the performance of the well-trained DGNN model on the test-time dynamic graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DyGEval serves as an effective evaluator for assessing various DGNN backbones across different dynamic graphs under distribution shifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Homophily in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23773v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets, thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in reasoning-intensive question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Modality-Tailored Graph Modeling Framework for Urban Region Representation via Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23772v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling multimodal urban data and learning region representations for various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. (1) They typically employ identical graph neural network architectures across all modalities, failing to capture modality-specific structures and characteristics. (2) During the fusion stage, they often neglect spatial heterogeneity by assuming that the aggregation weights of different modalities remain invariant across regions, resulting in suboptimal representations. To address these issues, we propose MTGRR, a modality-tailored graph modeling framework for urban region representation, built upon a multimodal dataset comprising point of interest (POI), taxi mobility, land use, road element, remote sensing, and street view images. (1) MTGRR categorizes modalities into two groups based on spatial density and data characteristics: aggregated-level and point-level modalities. For aggregated-level modalities, MTGRR employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) graph architecture, where each modality is processed by a dedicated expert GNN to capture distinct modality-specific characteristics. For the point-level modality, a dual-level GNN is constructed to extract fine-grained visual semantic features. (2) To obtain effective region representations under spatial heterogeneity, a spatially-aware multimodal fusion mechanism is designed to dynamically infer region-specific modality fusion weights. Building on this graph modeling framework, MTGRR further employs a joint contrastive learning strategy that integrates region aggregated-level, point-level, and fusion-level objectives to optimize region representations. Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities and three tasks demonstrate that MTGRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Final Layer Holds the Key: A Unified and Efficient GNN Calibration Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11335v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness on graph-based tasks. However, their predictive confidence is often miscalibrated, typically exhibiting under-confidence, which harms the reliability of their decisions. Existing calibration methods for GNNs normally introduce additional calibration components, which fail to capture the intrinsic relationship between the model and the prediction confidence, resulting in limited theoretical guarantees and increased computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet efficient graph calibration method. We establish a unified theoretical framework revealing that model confidence is jointly governed by class-centroid-level and node-level calibration at the final layer. Based on this insight, we theoretically show that reducing the weight decay of the final-layer parameters alleviates GNN under-confidence by acting on the class-centroid level, while node-level calibration acts as a finer-grained complement to class-centroid level calibration, which encourages each test node to be closer to its predicted class centroid at the final-layer representations. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |

Among them, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based methods have shown great potential due to their capability to explicitly model inter-variable dependencies. However, these methods often overlook the diversity of information among neighbors, which may lead to redundant information aggregation. In addition, their final prediction typically relies solely on the representation from a single temporal scale. To tackle these issues, we propose a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion (DIMIGNN). DIMIGNN introduces a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to ensure that each variable shares high informational similarity with its neighbors while maintaining diversity among neighbors themselves. Furthermore, a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) is introduced to dynamically adjust the contributions of prediction results from different temporal scales to the final forecasting result. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DIMIGNN consistently outperforms prior methods.</p></details> |  |

Class imbalance is also prevalent in graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically based on the assumption of class balance, often overlooking the issue of class imbalance. In our investigation, we identified a problem, which we term the Randomness Anomalous Connectivity Problem (RACP), where certain off-the-shelf models are affected by random seeds, leading to a significant performance degradation. To eliminate the influence of random factors in algorithms, we proposed PNS (Pure Node Sampling) to address the RACP in the node synthesis stage. Unlike existing approaches that design specialized algorithms to handle either quantity imbalance or topological imbalance, PNS is a novel plug-and-play module that operates directly during node synthesis to mitigate RACP. Moreover, PNS also alleviates performance degradation caused by abnormal distribution of node neighbors. We conduct a series of experiments to identify what factors are influenced by random seeds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our method, which not only eliminates the effect of unfavorable random seeds but also outperforms the baseline across various benchmark datasets with different GNN backbones.

However, existing heterogeneous graph models often struggle to capture long-range information or necessitate stacking numerous layers to learn such dependencies, resulting in high computational complexity and encountering over-smoothing issues. In this paper, we propose a Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (VN-HGCN), which leverages virtual nodes to facilitate enhanced information flow within the graph. Virtual nodes are auxiliary nodes interconnected with all nodes of a specific type in the graph, facilitating efficient aggregation of long-range information across different types of nodes and edges. By incorporating virtual nodes into the graph structure, VN-HGCN achieves effective information aggregation with only $4$ layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that VN-HGCN can serve as a versatile framework that can be seamlessly applied to other HGNN models, showcasing its generalizability. Empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of VN-HGCN, and extensive experiments conducted on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over several state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

This issue is also prevalent in graph-structured data. Most graph neural networks (GNNs) implicitly assume a balanced class distribution and therefore often fail to account for the challenges introduced by class imbalance, which can lead to biased learning and degraded performance on minority classes. We identify a quality inconsistency problem in synthesized nodes, which leads to suboptimal performance under graph imbalance conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose GraphIFE (Graph Invariant Feature Extraction), a novel framework designed to mitigate quality inconsistency in synthesized nodes. Our approach incorporates two key concepts from graph invariant learning and introduces strategies to strengthen the embedding space representation, thereby enhancing the model's ability to identify invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's efficiency and robust generalization, as GraphIFE consistently outperforms various baselines across multiple datasets.

However, their message passing, heavily relying on Clebsch-Gordan tensor product convolutions, suffers from restricted expressiveness due to the limited non-linearity and low degree of group representations. To overcome this, we introduce the Equivariant Spherical Transformer (EST), a novel plug-and-play framework that applies a Transformer-like architecture to the Fourier spatial domain of group representations. EST achieves higher expressiveness than conventional models while preserving the crucial equivariant inductive bias through a uniform sampling strategy of spherical Fourier transforms. As demonstrated by our experiments on challenging benchmarks like OC20 and QM9, EST-based models achieve state-of-the-art performance. For the complex molecular systems within OC20, small models empowered by EST can outperform some larger models and those using additional data.

Despite their success, message-passing suffers from fundamental limitations -- including constrained expressiveness, over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited capacity to model long-range dependencies. These issues hinder scalability: increasing data size or model size often fails to yield improved performance. To this end, we explore pathways beyond message-passing and introduce Generative Graph Pattern Machine (G$^2$PM), a generative Transformer pre-training framework for graphs. G$^2$PM represents graph instances (nodes, edges, or entire graphs) as sequences of substructures, and employs generative pre-training over the sequences to learn generalizable and transferable representations. Empirically, G$^2$PM demonstrates strong scalability: on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark, it continues to improve with model sizes up to 60M parameters, outperforming prior generative approaches that plateau at significantly smaller scales (e.g., 3M). In addition, we systematically analyze the model design space, highlighting key architectural choices that contribute to its scalability and generalization. Across diverse tasks -- including node/link/graph classification, transfer learning, and cross-graph pretraining -- G$^2$PM consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing a compelling foundation for scalable graph learning. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/G2PM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Graph Embeddings and Louvain Algorithm for Unsupervised Community Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23411v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel community detection method that integrates the Louvain algorithm with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), enabling the discovery of communities without prior knowledge. Compared to most existing solutions, the proposed method does not require prior knowledge of the number of communities. It enhances the Louvain algorithm using node embeddings generated by a GNN to capture richer structural and feature information. Furthermore, it introduces a merging algorithm to refine the results of the enhanced Louvain algorithm, reducing the number of detected communities. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one that improves the Louvain algorithm using GNNs for community detection. The improvement of the proposed method was empirically confirmed through an evaluation on real-world datasets. The results demonstrate its ability to dynamically adjust the number of detected communities and increase the detection accuracy in comparison with the benchmark solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in ICMLT 2025 conference proceedings</p></details> |
| **[Flow-Attentional Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06127v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential for learning from graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs do not consider the conservation law inherent in graphs associated with a flow of physical resources, such as electrical current in power grids or traffic in transportation networks, which can lead to reduced model performance. To address this, we propose flow attention, which adapts existing graph attention mechanisms to satisfy Kirchhoff$\text{'}$s first law. Furthermore, we discuss how this modification influences the expressivity and identify sets of non-isomorphic graphs that can be discriminated by flow attention but not by standard attention. Through extensive experiments on two flow graph datasets (electronic circuits and power grids) we demonstrate that flow attention enhances the performance of attention-based GNNs on both graph-level classification and regression tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted @ Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR): https://openreview.net/forum?id=tOzg7UxTPD</p></details> |
| **[Towards Quantum-Ready Blockchain Fraud Detection via Ensemble Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23101v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blockchain Business applications and cryptocurrencies such as enable secure, decentralized value transfer, yet their pseudonymous nature creates opportunities for illicit activity, challenging regulators and exchanges in anti money laundering (AML) enforcement. Detecting fraudulent transactions in blockchain networks requires models that can capture both structural and temporal dependencies while remaining resilient to noise, imbalance, and adversarial behavior. In this work, we propose an ensemble framework that integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to enhance blockchain fraud detection. Using the real-world Elliptic dataset, our tuned soft voting ensemble achieves high recall of illicit transactions while maintaining a false positive rate below 1%, beating individual GNN models and baseline methods. The modular architecture incorporates quantum-ready design hooks, allowing seamless future integration of quantum feature mappings and hybrid quantum classical graph neural networks. This ensures scalability, robustness, and long-term adaptability as quantum computing technologies mature. Our findings highlight ensemble GNNs as a practical and forward-looking solution for real-time cryptocurrency monitoring, providing both immediate AML utility and a pathway toward quantum-enhanced financial security analytics.</p></details> |  |
| **[GuardNet: Graph-Attention Filtering for Jailbreak Defense in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23037v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which are adversarial prompts that bypass alignment constraints and induce unauthorized or harmful behaviors. These vulnerabilities undermine the safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LLM outputs, posing critical risks in domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal compliance. In this paper, we propose GuardNet, a hierarchical filtering framework that detects and filters jailbreak prompts prior to inference. GuardNet constructs structured graphs that combine sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived token relations to capture both linguistic structure and contextual patterns indicative of jailbreak behavior. It then applies graph neural networks at two levels: (i) a prompt-level filter that detects global adversarial prompts, and (ii) a token-level filter that pinpoints fine-grained adversarial spans. Extensive experiments across three datasets and multiple attack settings show that GuardNet substantially outperforms prior defenses. It raises prompt-level F$_1$ scores from 66.4\% to 99.8\% on LLM-Fuzzer, and from 67-79\% to over 94\% on PLeak datasets. At the token level, GuardNet improves F$_1$ from 48-75\% to 74-91\%, with IoU gains up to +28\%. Despite its structural complexity, GuardNet maintains acceptable latency and generalizes well in cross-domain evaluations, making it a practical and robust defense against jailbreak threats in real-world LLM deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[OptimES: Optimizing Federated Learning Using Remote Embeddings for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22922v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have experienced rapid advancements in recent years due to their ability to learn meaningful representations from graph data structures. However, in most real-world settings, such as financial transaction networks and healthcare networks, this data is localized to different data owners and cannot be aggregated due to privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a viable machine learning approach for training a shared model that iteratively aggregates local models trained on decentralized data. This addresses privacy concerns while leveraging parallelism. State-of-the-art methods enhance the privacy-respecting convergence accuracy of federated GNN training by sharing remote embeddings of boundary vertices through a server (EmbC). However, they are limited by diminished performance due to large communication costs. In this article, we propose OptimES, an optimized federated GNN training framework that employs remote neighbourhood pruning, overlapping the push of embeddings to the server with local training, and dynamic pulling of embeddings to reduce network costs and training time. We perform a rigorous evaluation of these strategies for four common graph datasets with up to $111M$ vertices and $1.8B$ edges. We see that a modest drop in per-round accuracy due to the preemptive push of embeddings is out-stripped by the reduction in per-round training time for large and dense graphs like Reddit and Products, converging up to $\approx 3.5\times$ faster than EmbC and giving up to $\approx16\%$ better accuracy than the default federated GNN learning. While accuracy improvements over default federated GNNs are modest for sparser graphs like Arxiv and Papers, they achieve the target accuracy about $\approx11\times$ faster than EmbC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended full-length version of paper that appeared at Euro-Par 2024: "Optimizing Federated Learning Using Remote Embeddings for Graph Neural Networks", Pranjal Naman and Yogesh Simmhan, in International European Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing (Euro-Par), 2024.

| **[Lexicon-Enriched Graph Modeling for Arabic Document Readability Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22870v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a graph-based approach enriched with lexicons to predict document-level readability in Arabic, developed as part of the Constrained Track of the BAREC Shared Task 2025. Our system models each document as a sentence-level graph, where nodes represent sentences and lemmas, and edges capture linguistic relationships such as lexical co-occurrence and class membership. Sentence nodes are enriched with features from the SAMER lexicon as well as contextual embeddings from the Arabic transformer model. The graph neural network (GNN) and transformer sentence encoder are trained as two independent branches, and their predictions are combined via late fusion at inference. For document-level prediction, sentence-level outputs are aggregated using max pooling to reflect the most difficult sentence. Experimental results show that this hybrid method outperforms standalone GNN or transformer branches across multiple readability metrics. Overall, the findings highlight that fusion offers advantages at the document level, but the GNN-only approach remains stronger for precise prediction of sentence-level readability.</p></details> |  |
