| **[Explainable AI in Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Solar Storms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16543v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A deep learning model is often considered a black-box model, as its internal workings tend to be opaque to the user. Because of the lack of transparency, it is challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions. Here, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm prediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism, aims to predict whether an active region (AR) on the Sun's surface that produces a flare within 24 hours will also produce a CME associated with the flare. The crux of our approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use the LSTM network to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. To make the model's predictions accountable and reliable, we leverage post hoc model-agnostic techniques, which help elucidate the factors contributing to the predicted output for an input sequence and provide insights into the model's behavior across multiple sequences within an AR. To our knowledge, this is the first time that interpretability has been added to an LSTM-based solar storm prediction model.</p></details> | 6 pages, 8 figures |

The information transmission rate is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling (PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal time-series data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[PENGUIN: Enhancing Transformer with Periodic-Nested Group Attention for Long-term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13773v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a fundamental task with wide-ranging applications. Although Transformer-based models have made significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and Transformer-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autocorrelation functions for point-process time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08070v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article introduces autocorrelograms for time series of point processes. Such time series usually arise when a longer temporal or spatio-temporal point process is sliced into smaller time units; for example, when an annual process is sliced into 365 daily replications. We assume the point processes follow a doubly-stochastic Poisson model with log-Gaussian intensity functions. The proposed autocorrelograms are computationally simple and based on binning. The asymptotic distribution of the autocorrelations is established. The ability of the method to detect the patterns of common autoregressive and moving-average time series models is shown by simulation. Two examples of application to temporal and spatial point-process time series are shown, pertaining bike demand in the Divvy bike-sharing system of Chicago and street theft in Chicago, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Factor Models of Matrix-Valued Time Series: Nonstationarity and Cointegration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11358v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider the nonstationary matrix-valued time series with common stochastic trends. Unlike the traditional factor analysis which flattens matrix observations into vectors, we adopt a matrix factor model in order to fully explore the intrinsic matrix structure in the data, allowing interaction between the row and column stochastic trends, and subsequently improving the estimation convergence. It also reduces the computation complexity in estimation. The main estimation methodology is built on the eigenanalysis of sample row and column covariance matrices when the nonstationary matrix factors are of full rank and the idiosyncratic components are temporally stationary, and is further extended to tackle a more flexible setting when the matrix factors are cointegrated and the idiosyncratic components may be nonstationary. Under some mild conditions which allow the existence of weak factors, we derive the convergence theory for the estimated factor loading matrices and nonstationary factor matrices. In particular, the developed methodology and theory are applicable to the general case of heterogeneous strengths over weak factors. An easy-to-implement ratio criterion is adopted to consistently estimate the size of latent factor matrix. Both simulation and empirical studies are conducted to examine the numerical performance of the developed model and methodology in finite samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Time Series into LLMs via Multi-layer Steerable Embedding Fusion for Enhanced Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16059v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series (TS) data are ubiquitous across various application areas, rendering time series forecasting (TSF) a fundamental task. With the astounding advances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been developed to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the potential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently constrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs typically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input layer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in deeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual embeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to directly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the progressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF leverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically rich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across LLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are designed to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual modalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures efficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared with baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE. The code is available at https://github.com/One1sAll/MSEF.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in CIKM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Generative Foundation Model for Structured and Unstructured Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16054v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics, vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining, where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction (NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and 30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation, GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to additional modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluation of Time Series Forecasting Models for Predicting Lung Cancer Mortality Rates in the United States: A Comparison with Altuhaifa (2023) Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16052v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper evaluates the performance of the following time series forecasting models - Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), Holt's Double Exponential Smoothing (HDES), and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) - in predicting lung cancer mortality rates in the United States. It builds upon the work of Altuhaifa, which used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data from 1975-2018 to evaluate these models. Altuhaifa's study found that ARIMA (0,2,2), SES with smoothing parameter $\alpha=0.995$, and HDES with parameters $\alpha=0.4$ and $\beta=0.9$ were the optimal models from their analysis, with HDES providing the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 132.91. The paper extends the dataset to 2021 and re-evaluates the models. Using the same SEER data from 1975-2021, it identifies ARIMA (0,2,2), SES ($\alpha=0.999$), and HDES ($\alpha=0.5221$, $\beta=0.5219$) as the best-fitting models. Interestingly, ARIMA (0,2,2) and HDES yield the lowest RMSE of 2.56. To obtain forecasts with higher accuracy, an average model (HDES-ARIMA) consisting of HDES and ARIMA was constructed to leverage their strengths. The HDES-ARIMA model also achieves an RMSE of 2.56. The forecast from the average model suggests declining lung cancer mortality rates in the United States. The study highlights how expanding datasets and re-evaluating models can provide updated insights. It recommends further analysis using monthly data separated by gender, ethnicity, and state to understand lung cancer mortality dynamics in the United States. Overall, advanced time series methods like HDES and ARIMA show strong potential for accurately forecasting this major public health issue.</p></details> |  |

The proposed model integrates the temporal dependency modeling strengths of MTFs with the sophisticated pattern recognition capabilities of Transformer architectures. We evaluate the model's performance using the InSDN dataset, demonstrating that our model outperforms baseline classification models, particularly in data-constrained environments commonly encountered in SDN applications. We also highlight the relationship between the MTF and Transformer components, which leads to better performance, even with limited data. Furthermore, our approach achieves competitive training and inference times, making it an efficient solution for real-world SDN applications. These findings establish the potential of MTF-aided Transformers to address the challenges of time series classification in SDNs, offering a promising path for reliable and scalable analysis in scenarios with sparse data.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Transforming Causality: Transformer-Based Temporal Causal Discovery with Prior Knowledge Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15928v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel framework for temporal causal discovery and inference that addresses two key challenges: complex nonlinear dependencies and spurious correlations. Our approach employs a multi-layer Transformer-based time-series forecaster to capture long-range, nonlinear temporal relationships among variables. After training, we extract the underlying causal structure and associated time lags from the forecaster using gradient-based analysis, enabling the construction of a causal graph. To mitigate the impact of spurious causal relationships, we introduce a prior knowledge integration mechanism based on attention masking, which consistently enforces user-excluded causal links across multiple Transformer layers. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a 12.8% improvement in F1-score for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in estimating causal lags.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tutorial on the Probabilistic Unification of Estimation Theory, Machine Learning, and Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15719v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Time-Series Causal Discovery with Approximate Causal Ordering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05500v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery in time-series data presents a significant computational challenge. Standard algorithms are often prohibitively expensive for datasets with many variables or samples. This study introduces and validates a heuristic approximation of the VarLiNGAM algorithm to address this scalability problem. The standard VarLiNGAM method relies on an iterative search, recalculating statistical dependencies after each step. Our heuristic modifies this procedure by omitting the iterative refinement. This change permits a one-time precomputation of all necessary statistical values. The algorithmic modification reduces the time complexity from $O(m^3n)$ to $O(m^2n + m^3)$ while keeping the space complexity at $O(m^2)$, where $m$ is the number of variables and $n$ is the number of samples. While an approximation, our approach retains VarLiNGAM's essential structure and empirical reliability. On large-scale financial data with up to 400 variables, our algorithm achieves a 7--13x speedup over the standard implementation and a 4.5x speedup over a GPU-accelerated version. Evaluations across medical imaging, web server monitoring, and finance demonstrate the heuristic's robustness and practical scalability. This work offers a validated balance between computational efficiency and discovery quality, making large-scale causal analysis feasible on personal computers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph topology estimation of power grids using pairwise mutual information of time series data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11517v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The topology of a power grid is estimated using an information theoretic approach. By modeling the grid as a graph and using voltage magnitude data of individual nodes in the grid, the mutual information between pairs of nodes is computed using different approximation methods. Using the well-known Chow-Liu algorithm, a maximum spanning tree based on mutual information is computed to estimate the power grid topology. This manuscript explores the application of this method to different datasets and explores the domain of applicability. The data quality, precision, time windows, frequency and the method for calculating the mutual information are varied to see the effect on the successful reconstruction of the graph and it's leaf nodes. Success shown for IEEE networks generated with MATPOWER and data generated using GridLAB-D. The algorithm is then cross-validated on IEEE networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-Powered Machine Learning Approaches for Fault Diagnosis in Industrial Pumps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15550v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate, pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied, combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the 95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts. Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur. Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive maintenance in complex systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CC-Time: Cross-Model and Cross-Modality Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12235v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in various application fields beyond natural language processing, language models have raised emerging attention in the field of time series forecasting (TSF) and have shown great prospects. However, current PLM-based TSF methods still fail to achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy matching the strong sequential modeling power of language models. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Model and Cross-Modality Learning with PLMs for time series forecasting (CC-Time). We explore the potential of PLMs for time series forecasting from two aspects: 1) what time series features could be modeled by PLMs, and 2) whether relying solely on PLMs is sufficient for building time series models. In the first aspect, CC-Time incorporates cross-modality learning to model temporal dependency and channel correlations in the language model from both time series sequences and their corresponding text descriptions. In the second aspect, CC-Time further proposes the cross-model fusion block to adaptively integrate knowledge from the PLMs and time series model to form a more comprehensive modeling of time series patterns. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that CC-Time achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in both full-data training and few-shot learning situations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Adaptable High-throughput Streaming Aggregation Engines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18168v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aggregation queries are a series of computationally-demanding analytics operations on counted, grouped or time series data. They include tasks such as summation or finding the median among the items of the same group, and within a specified number of the last observed tuples for sliding window aggregation (SWAG). They have a wide range of applications including database analytics, operating systems, bank security and medical sensors. Existing challenges include the hardware complexity that comes with efficiently handling per-group states using hash-based approaches. This paper presents an adaptable pipeline for calculating a wide range of aggregation queries with high throughput. It is then adapted for SWAG and achieves up to 476x speedup over the CPU core of the same platform. It achieves unparalleled levels of performance and functionality such as a throughput of 1 GT/s on our setup for SWAG without groups, and more advanced operators with up to 4x the window sizes than the state-of-the-art with groups as an approximation for SWAG featuring per-group windows using a fraction of the resources and no DRAM.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate its efficacy using multiple real-world datasets, showcasing superior performance in accuracy and adaptability compared to reference models. The approach offers valuable insights for strategic decision-making across industries facing financial and marketing forecasting challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE CiFer Companion 2025. 5 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[DiagECG: An LLM-Driven Framework for Diagnostic Reasoning via Discretized ECG Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15338v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task, enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model, DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning-Based Financial Time Series Forecasting via Sliding Window and Variational Mode Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12565v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the complexity of financial time series, this paper proposes a forecasting model combining sliding window and variational mode decomposition (VMD) methods. Historical stock prices and relevant market indicators are used to construct datasets. VMD decomposes non-stationary financial time series into smoother subcomponents, improving model adaptability. The decomposed data is then input into a deep learning model for prediction. The study compares the forecasting effects of an LSTM model trained on VMD-processed sequences with those using raw time series, demonstrating better performance and stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning ECG Representations via Poly-Window Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15225v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models. Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised representation learning in biomedical time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics 2025.

| **[SleepDIFFormer: Sleep Stage Classification via Multivariate Differential Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15215v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error. Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns. These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/Ben1001409/SleepDIFFormer</p></details> | 8 Pages |
| **[On the Performance of Linear Adaptive Filters driven by the Ergodic Chaotic Logistic Map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15143v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chaotic dynamical systems are increasingly considered for use in coding and transmission systems. This stems from their parameter sensitivity and spectral characteristics. The latter are relevant for channel estimation methods. In particular the logistic map $f_\lambda =\lambda x\left( 1-x\right) $ has been employed in chaotic coding and spread spectrum transmission systems. For $\lambda =4$ the statistical properties of sequences generated by $f_4$ are considered as ideal drive signals for channel estimation schemes. This assumption is proven in the present paper. To this end the higher order statistical moments and the autocorrelation of time series generated by $f_4$ are derived. It is shown that for $\lambda =4$ the zero mean time series is uncorrelated. The adaptation performance of finite impulse response (FIR) digital adaptive filters (DAF) used for channel estimation is analyzed. It is shown that using zero mean sequences of $f_4$ leads to the maximal possible FIR DAF performance. An optimal value for the damping parameter in the LMS scheme is derived that leads to the maximal performance and ensures stability. The analytic considerations are confirmed by simulation results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smart Charging Impact Analysis using Clustering Methods and Real-world Distribution Feeders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15092v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The anticipated widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates a critical evaluation of existing power distribution infrastructures, as EV integration imposes additional stress on distribution networks that can lead to component overloading and power quality degradation. Implementing smart charging mechanisms can mitigate these adverse effects and defer or even avoid upgrades. This study assesses the performance of two smart charging strategies - Time of Use (TOU) pricing and Load Balancing (LB) on seven representative real-world feeders identified using k-means clustering. A time series-based steady-state load flow analysis was conducted on these feeders to simulate the impact of EV charging under both strategies across four different EV enrollment scenarios and three representative days to capture seasonal load characteristics. A grid upgrade strategy has been proposed to strengthen the power grid to support EV integration with minimal cost. Results demonstrate that both TOU and LB strategies effectively manage the additional EV load with reduced upgrade requirement and cost to existing infrastructure compared to the case without smart charging strategies and LB outperforms TOU when the customer enrollment levels are high. These findings support the viability of smart charging in facilitating EV integration while maintaining distribution network reliability and reducing investment cost.</p></details> |  |

However, satellite time series are voluminous and often corrupted, making them challenging to use. We present TESSERA, an open, global, land-oriented remote sensing foundation model that uses self-supervised learning to generate `ready-to-use' embeddings at 10~m scale from pixel-level satellite time-series data. TESSERA uses two encoders to combine optical data with synthetic aperture radar backscatter coefficients at 10~m resolution to create embeddings that are fused with a multilayer perceptron to create annual global embedding maps. We compare our work with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models in five diverse downstream tasks and find that TESSERA closely matches or outperforms these baselines. We believe that TESSERA's ease of use, state-of-the-art performance, openness, and computation- and labelled data-efficiency will prove transformative in a wide range of ecological applications.</p></details> |  |

Quantum recurrent models like QLSTM are promising for time-series prediction, NLP, and reinforcement learning.

To address this, we propose DiffQAS-QLSTM, an end-to-end differentiable framework that optimizes both VQC parameters and architecture selection during training.

However, a persistent challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation by enabling intelligent real-time decision-making, thereby reducing the energy consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a significant advance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves an accuracy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters while surpassing the current baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Applications of Medical AI (AMAI workshop) at MICCAI 2025 (submitted version)</p></details> |
| **[A Collusion-Resistance Privacy-Preserving Smart Metering Protocol for Operational Utility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14744v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern grids have adopted advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to facilitate bidirectional communication between smart meters and control centers. This enables smart meters to report consumption values at predefined intervals to utility providers for purposes including demand balancing, load forecasting, dynamic billing, and operational efficiency. Compared to traditional power grids, smart grids offer advantages such as enhanced reliability, improved energy efficiency, and increased security. However, utility providers can compromise user privacy by analyzing fine-grained readings and extracting individuals' daily activities from this time-series data. To address this concern, we propose a collusion-resistant, privacy-preserving aggregation protocol for smart metering in operational services. Our protocol ensures privacy by leveraging techniques such as partially additive homomorphic encryption, aggregation, data perturbation, and data minimization. The scheme aggregates perturbed readings using the additive homomorphic property of the Paillier cryptosystem to provide results for multiple operational purposes. We evaluate the protocol in terms of both performance and privacy. Computational, memory, and communication overhead were examined. The total execution time with 1024-bit key size is about 2.21 seconds. We also evaluated privacy through the normalized conditional entropy (NCE) metric. Higher NCE values, closer to 1, indicate stronger privacy. By increasing noise scale, the NCE value rises, showing perturbed values retain minimal information about the original, thereby reducing risks. Overall, evaluation demonstrates the protocol's efficiency while employing various privacy-preserving techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Feature engineering, whereby existing features are transformed to make new ones, is critical for enhancing model performance, but is often manual and time-intensive. Existing automation attempts rely on exhaustive enumeration, which can be computationally costly and lacks domain-specific insights. We introduce ELATE (Evolutionary Language model for Automated Time-series Engineering), which leverages a language model within an evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series data. ELATE employs time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics to guide and prune features, while the language model proposes new, contextually relevant feature transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that ELATE improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 4 figures.

Focusing on conditions observed over half tidal cycles, we observe that such data fall within the framework of functional extreme value theory, but violate standard assumptions due to temporal dependence and short-tailed behavior.a To address this, we propose a two-stage methodology. First, we introduce an autoregressive model to eliminate temporal dependence between cycles. Second, considering the model residuals, we adapt existing techniques based on Pareto processes. This allows us to build a simulator of extreme scenarios, by applying inverse transformations. These simulations depend on an initial time series, which can be randomly selected to tune the desired level of extremes. We validate the simulator performance by comparing simulated times series with observations, through several criteria, based on principal component analysis, extreme value analysis, and classification algorithms. The approach is applied to the surge data, on the G{\^a}vres site, located in southern Brittany, France.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Pre-Trained Time Series Models for Electricity Price Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08113v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate electricity price forecasting (EPF) is crucial for effective decision-making in power trading on the spot market. While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have inspired the development of numerous time series foundation models (TSFMs) for time series forecasting, their effectiveness in EPF remains uncertain. To address this gap, we benchmark several state-of-the-art pretrained models--Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-T5, TimesFM, Moirai, Time-MoE, and TimeGPT--against established statistical and machine learning (ML) methods for EPF. Using 2024 day-ahead auction (DAA) electricity prices from Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium, we generate daily forecasts with a one-day horizon. Chronos-Bolt and Time-MoE emerge as the strongest among the TSFMs, performing on par with traditional models. However, the biseasonal MSTL model, which captures daily and weekly seasonality, stands out for its consistent performance across countries and evaluation metrics, with no TSFM statistically outperforming it.</p></details> |  |
| **[Artificial Intelligence-Based Multiscale Temporal Modeling for Anomaly Detection in Cloud Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14503v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision, enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed, covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios, and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision, recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior capability in complex cloud environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Organ-Agents: Virtual Human Physiology Simulator via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14357v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g., cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from 7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops (<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in critical care.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Autoregressive Switching Processes with Cumulative Shrinkage Priors for Graphical Modeling of Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03385v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a flexible Bayesian approach for sparse Gaussian graphical modeling of multivariate time series. We account for temporal correlation in the data by assuming that observations are characterized by an underlying and unobserved hidden discrete autoregressive process. We assume multivariate Gaussian emission distributions and capture spatial dependencies by modeling the state-specific precision matrices via graphical horseshoe priors. We characterize the mixing probabilities of the hidden process via a cumulative shrinkage prior that accommodates zero-inflated parameters for non-active components, and further incorporate a sparsity-inducing Dirichlet prior to estimate the effective number of states from the data. For posterior inference, we develop a sampling procedure that allows estimation of the number of discrete autoregressive lags and the number of states, and that cleverly avoids having to deal with the changing dimensions of the parameter space. We thoroughly investigate performance of our proposed methodology through several simulation studies. We further illustrate the use of our approach for the estimation of dynamic brain connectivity based on fMRI data collected on a subject performing a task-based experiment on latent learning</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Agentic Workflows for Financial Time-Series Modeling with LLMs and Reflective Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13915v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection, code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning, robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that \textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Energy-Aware Time-Series Model Deployment on Embedded FPGAs for Resilient Combined Sewer Overflow Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13905v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, increasingly challenge aging combined sewer systems, raising the risk of untreated wastewater overflow. Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can provide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating uncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have offered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their reliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication outages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that enables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution integrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, compressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution. Moreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for optimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy consumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer data, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical measurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ per inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly less energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE 0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to align model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low energy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general, our work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more resilient combined sewer systems. All code can be found in the GitHub Repository (https://github.com/tianheng-ling/EdgeOverflowForecast).</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, accepted by the 11th IEEE International Smart Cities Conference</p></details> |

In this survey, we first systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases, Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than 180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust, high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation of autonomous embodied systems.</p></details> |  |

We consider a variant, where given a set of trajectories and a number of parts, we jointly partition the set of trajectories and learn linear dynamical system (LDS) models for each part, so as to minimize the maximum error across all the models. We present globally convergent methods and EM heuristics, accompanied by promising computational results. The key highlight of this method is that it does not require a predefined hidden state dimension but instead provides an upper bound. Additionally, it offers guidance for determining regularization in the system identification.</p></details> |  |

However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)\textit{The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the dependencies in the time series data effectively.} To address the first challenge, we explore the potential of state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denoising module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for time series data modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple real-world datasets.

| **[On the reconstruction limits of complex networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01437v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network reconstruction consists in retrieving the hidden interaction structure of a system from observations. Many reconstruction algorithms have been proposed, although less research has been devoted to describe their theoretical limitations. In this work, we take a first-principles approach and build on our earlier definition of reconstructability-the fraction of structural information recoverable from data. We relate this quantity to the true data-generating (TDG) process and delineate an information-theoretic reconstruction limit, i.e., the upper bound of the mutual information between the true underlying graph and any graph reconstructed from observations. These concepts lead us to a principled numerical method to assess the validity of empirically reconstructed networks, based on model selection and a quantity we introduce: the reconstruction index. This index approximates the reconstructability from data, quantifies the variability of the reconstructed network ensemble, and is shown to predict reconstruction error without requiring knowledge of the true underlying network. We characterize this method and test it on empirical time series and networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowState: Sampling Rate Invariant Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05287v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient. We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model, FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to varying input sampling rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review</p></details> |
| **[ERIS: An Energy-Guided Feature Disentanglement Framework for Out-of-Distribution Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14134v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this, current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\textbf{ERIS}) framework to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that ERIS improves upon state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy across four benchmarks.</p></details> | conference |
| **[HRS: Hybrid Representation Framework with Scheduling Awareness for Time Series Forecasting in Crowdsourced Cloud-Edge Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12839v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid proliferation of streaming services, network load exhibits highly time-varying and bursty behavior, posing serious challenges for maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) in Crowdsourced Cloud-Edge Platforms (CCPs). While CCPs leverage Predict-then-Schedule architecture to improve QoS and profitability, accurate load forecasting remains challenging under traffic surges. Existing methods either minimize mean absolute error, resulting in underprovisioning and potential Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations during peak periods, or adopt conservative overprovisioning strategies, which mitigate SLA risks at the expense of increased resource expenditure. To address this dilemma, we propose HRS, a hybrid representation framework with scheduling awareness that integrates numerical and image-based representations to better capture extreme load dynamics. We further introduce a Scheduling-Aware Loss (SAL) that captures the asymmetric impact of prediction errors, guiding predictions that better support scheduling decisions. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that HRS consistently outperforms ten baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing SLA violation rates by 63.1% and total profit loss by 32.3%.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 14 figures, ECAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing with Visibility Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19046v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of complex and nonlinear time series remains a challenging problem across engineering and scientific disciplines. Reservoir computing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional deep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly structured and fixed reservoir network. Despite its advantages, the largely random reservoir graph architecture often results in suboptimal and oversized networks with poorly understood dynamics. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that systematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input training sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG) technique, which converts time series data into networks by representing measurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network is constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data sequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid expensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is directly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study. We assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical nonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency. Compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) graph of the same size, spectral radius, and fixed density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent performance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG. An ER graph with density matched to the DyRC-VG can in some conditions outperform both approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures.

Accurate demographic forecasting is essential for informed decision-making in areas such as urban planning, healthcare, and economic policy. This study explores the application of time series foundation models to predict demographic changes in the United States using datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau and Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). We evaluate the performance of the Time Series Foundation Model (TimesFM) against traditional baselines including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Linear Regression. Our experiments across six demographically diverse states demonstrate that TimesFM achieves the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) in 86.67% of test cases, with particularly strong performance on minority populations with sparse historical data. These findings highlight the potential of pre-trained foundation models to enhance demographic analysis and inform proactive policy interventions without requiring extensive task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

In many applications involving multivariate time series, it is of interest to learn an interaction graph that treats each individual time series as nodes of the graph, with the presence of an edge between two nodes signifying conditional dependence given the others. Typically, the partial covariance is used as a measure of conditional dependence. However, in many applications, the outcomes may not be Gaussian and/or could be a mixture of different outcomes. For such time series using the partial covariance as a measure of conditional dependence may be restrictive. In this article, we propose a broad class of time series models which are specifically designed to succinctly encode process-wide conditional independence in its parameters. For each univariate component in the time series, we model its conditional distribution with a distribution from the exponential family. We develop a notion of process-wide compatibility under which such conditional specifications can be stitched together to form a well-defined strictly stationary multivariate time series. We call this construction a conditionally exponential stationary graphical model ({\it CEStGM}). A central quantity underlying CEStGM is a positive kernel which we call the interaction kernel. Spectral properties of such positive kernel operators constitute a core technical foundation of this work. We establish process-wide local and global Markov properties of CEStGM exploiting a Hammersley-Clifford type decomposition of the interaction kernel. Further, we study various probabilistic properties of CEStGM and show that it is geometrically mixing. An approximate Gibbs sampler is also developed to simulate sample paths of CEStGM.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedKGent: A Large Language Model Agent Framework for Constructing Temporally Evolving Medical Knowledge Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12393v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of medical literature presents growing challenges for structuring and integrating domain knowledge at scale. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a promising solution by enabling efficient retrieval, automated reasoning, and knowledge discovery. However, current KG construction methods often rely on supervised pipelines with limited generalizability or naively aggregate outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), treating biomedical corpora as static and ignoring the temporal dynamics and contextual uncertainty of evolving knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce MedKGent, a LLM agent framework for constructing temporally evolving medical KGs. Leveraging over 10 million PubMed abstracts published between 1975 and 2023, we simulate the emergence of biomedical knowledge via a fine-grained daily time series. MedKGent incrementally builds the KG in a day-by-day manner using two specialized agents powered by the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model. The Extractor Agent identifies knowledge triples and assigns confidence scores via sampling-based estimation, which are used to filter low-confidence extractions and inform downstream processing. The Constructor Agent incrementally integrates the retained triples into a temporally evolving graph, guided by confidence scores and timestamps to reinforce recurring knowledge and resolve conflicts. The resulting KG contains 156,275 entities and 2,971,384 relational triples. Quality assessments by two SOTA LLMs and three domain experts demonstrate an accuracy approaching 90%, with strong inter-rater agreement. To evaluate downstream utility, we conduct RAG across seven medical question answering benchmarks using five leading LLMs, consistently observing significant improvements over non-augmented baselines. Case studies further demonstrate the KG's value in literature-based drug repurposing via confidence-aware causal inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simultaneous inference for monotone and smoothly time-varying functions under complex temporal dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02177v4)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new framework for the simultaneous inference of monotone and smoothly time-varying functions under complex temporal dynamics. This will be done utilizing the monotone rearrangement and the nonparametric estimation. We capitalize the Gaussian approximation for the nonparametric monotone estimator and construct the asymptotically correct simultaneous confidence bands (SCBs) using designed bootstrap methods. We investigate two general and practical scenarios. The first is the simultaneous inference of monotone smooth trends from moderately high-dimensional time series. The proposed algorithm has been employed for the joint inference of temperature curves from multiple areas. Specifically, most existing methods are designed for a single monotone smooth trend. In such cases, our proposed SCB empirically exhibits the narrowest width among existing approaches while maintaining confidence levels. It has also been used for testing several hypotheses tailored to global warming. The second scenario involves simultaneous inference of monotone and smoothly time-varying regression coefficients in time-varying coefficient linear models. The proposed algorithm has been utilized for testing the impact of sunshine duration on temperature which is believed to be increasing due to severe greenhouse effect. The validity of the proposed methods has been justified in theory as well as by extensive simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[DualSG: A Dual-Stream Explicit Semantic-Guided Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21830v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications. Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively, methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs, rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation. Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025 (ACM MM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[EventTSF: Event-Aware Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13434v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality, resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF), an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions. Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Identification and Estimation of Multi-order Tensor Factor Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13418v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework in high-dimensional factor models to simultaneously analyze multiple tensor time series, each with potentially different tensor orders and dimensionality. The connection between different tensor time series is through their global factors that are correlated to each other. A salient feature of our model is that when all tensor time series have the same order, it can be regarded as an extension of multilevel factor models from vectors to general tensors. Under very mild conditions, we separate the global and local components in the proposed model. Parameter estimation is thoroughly discussed. With strong correlation between global factors and noise allowed, we derive the rates of convergence of our estimators, which can be more superior than those of existing methods for multilevel factor models. We also develop estimators that are more computationally efficient, with rates of convergence spelt out. Extensive experiments are performed under various settings, corroborating with the pronounced theoretical results. As a real application example, we analyze a set of taxi data to study the traffic flow between Times Squares and its neighboring areas.</p></details> | 47 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer Using Multimodal Learning on Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06627v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers, and early detection remains a major clinical challenge due to the absence of specific symptoms and reliable biomarkers. In this work, we propose a new multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series, pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new biomarkers. Our code is available at https://github.com/MosbahAouad/EarlyPDAC-MML.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Cost-Effective Framework for Predicting Parking Availability Using Geospatial Data and Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14125v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As urban populations continue to grow, cities face numerous challenges in managing parking and determining occupancy. This issue is particularly pronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking spots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability of parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing efficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a smart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps, mobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive days with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require any sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to provide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location services. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to specify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was employed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of Determination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142 and highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an LSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.</p></details> |  |

Efficient data engineering is critical to handle challenges of latency, scalability, and consistency. Modern data lakehouse formats Delta Parquet, Apache Iceberg, and Apache Hudi offer features such as ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and real-time ingestion, combining the strengths of data lakes and warehouses to support complex use cases. This study presents a comparative analysis of Delta Parquet, Iceberg, and Hudi using real-world time-series automotive telemetry data with fields such as vehicle ID, timestamp, location, and event metrics. The evaluation considers modeling strategies, partitioning, CDC support, query performance, scalability, data consistency, and ecosystem maturity. Key findings show Delta Parquet provides strong ML readiness and governance, Iceberg delivers high performance for batch analytics and cloud-native workloads, while Hudi is optimized for real-time ingestion and incremental processing. Each format exhibits tradeoffs in query efficiency, time-travel, and update semantics. The study offers insights for selecting or combining formats to support fleet management, predictive maintenance, and route optimization. Using structured datasets and realistic queries, the results provide practical guidance for scaling data pipelines and integrating machine learning models in automotive applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in SSRG International Journal of Computer Science and Engineering (IJCSE), July 2025.

However, existing methods often rely on point estimates or purely data-driven models, which tend to falter under data scarcity. We propose a time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals to serve as structured priors for generative modeling. Our method, ODE-Diff, bridges mechanistic and data-driven approaches, enabling more reliable and interpretable causal inference. We evaluate ODE-Diff across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations, synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and distributional accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Shrinkage in High-Dimensional VAR Models: A Comparative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05489v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional vector autoregressive (VAR) models offer a versatile framework for multivariate time series analysis, yet face critical challenges from over-parameterization and uncertain lag order. In this paper, we systematically compare three Bayesian shrinkage priors (horseshoe, lasso, and normal) and two frequentist regularization approaches (ridge and nonparametric shrinkage) under three carefully crafted simulation scenarios. These scenarios encompass (i) overfitting in a low-dimensional setting, (ii) sparse high-dimensional processes, and (iii) a combined scenario where both large dimension and overfitting complicate inference. We evaluate each method in quality of parameter estimation (root mean squared error, coverage, and interval length) and out-of-sample forecasting (one-step-ahead forecast RMSE). Our findings show that local-global Bayesian methods, particularly the horseshoe, dominate in maintaining accurate coverage and minimizing parameter error, even when the model is heavily over-parameterized. Frequentist ridge often yields competitive point forecasts but underestimates uncertainty, leading to sub-nominal coverage. A real-data application using macroeconomic variables from Canada illustrates how these methods perform in practice, reinforcing the advantages of local-global priors in stabilizing inference when dimension or lag order is inflated.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Explainable AI based approach for Monitoring Animal Health](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10210v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring cattle health and optimizing yield are key challenges faced by dairy farmers due to difficulties in tracking all animals on the farm. This work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data, including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency, Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models for sustainable livestock management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer -- Towards Foundational Digital Twins in Process Industry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13111v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational modelling of multi-dimensional time-series data in industrial systems presents a central trade-off: channel-dependent (CD) models capture specific cross-variable dynamics but lack robustness and adaptability as model layers are commonly bound to the data dimensionality of the tackled use-case, while channel-independent (CI) models offer generality at the cost of modelling the explicit interactions crucial for system-level predictive regression tasks. To resolve this, we propose the Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer (CGPT), a novel architecture that integrates a known causal graph as an inductive bias. The core of CGPT is built around a pairwise modeling paradigm, tackling the CD/CI conflict by decomposing the multidimensional data into pairs. The model uses channel-agnostic learnable layers where all parameter dimensions are independent of the number of variables. CGPT enforces a CD information flow at the pair-level and CI-like generalization across pairs. This approach disentangles complex system dynamics and results in a highly flexible architecture that ensures scalability and any-variate adaptability. We validate CGPT on a suite of synthetic and real-world industrial datasets on long-term and one-step forecasting tasks designed to simulate common industrial complexities. Results demonstrate that CGPT significantly outperforms both CI and CD baselines in predictive accuracy and shows competitive performance with end-to-end trained CD models while remaining agnostic to the problem dimensionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, multivariate time series modeling faces challenges due to data complexity, uncertainty, and frequent regime shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics can introduce biases and limit generalization. This work compares two custom evaluation functions: FMAE (Focused Mean Absolute Error), focused on minimizing absolute errors, and HEF (Hierarchical Evaluation Function), designed to weight global metrics and penalize large deviations. Experiments were conducted under different data splits (91:9, 80:20, 70:30) using three optimizers (Grid Search, PSO, Optuna), assessing fit, relative accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Results show that HEF consistently outperforms FMAE in global metrics (R2, Relative Accuracy, RMSE, RMSSE), enhancing model robustness and explanatory power. These findings were confirmed via visualizations and statistical tests. Conversely, FMAE offers advantages in local metrics (MAE, MASE) and execution time, making it suitable for short-term scenarios. The study highlights a methodological trade-off: HEF is ideal for strategic planning, while FMAE is better suited for operational efficiency. A replicable framework is proposed for optimizing predictive models in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures, 110 tables.

This survey provides a comprehensive examination of spectral methods from classical Fourier analysis to modern neural operators, systematically summarizing three open challenges in current research: (1) causal structure preservation during spectral transformations, (2) uncertainty quantification in learned frequency representations, and (3) topology-aware analysis for non-Euclidean data structures. Through rigorous reviewing of over 100 studies, we develop a unified taxonomy that bridges conventional spectral techniques with cutting-edge machine learning approaches, while establishing standardized benchmarks for performance evaluation. Our work identifies key knowledge gaps in the field, particularly in geometric deep learning and quantum-enhanced spectral analysis.

Within each block, we provide an overview, specific hypotheses, we want to test, the resulting model and its implementation as well as an interpretation of the results.

| **[A self-supervised learning approach for denoising autoregressive models with additive noise: finite and infinite variance cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12970v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The autoregressive time series model is a popular second-order stationary process, modeling a wide range of real phenomena. However, in applications, autoregressive signals are often corrupted by additive noise. Further, the autoregressive process and the corruptive noise may be highly impulsive, stemming from an infinite-variance distribution. The model estimation techniques that account for additional noise tend to show reduced efficacy when there is very strong noise present in the data, especially when the noise is heavy-tailed. Moreover, identification of a model corrupted with heavy-tailed, particularly infinite-variance noise, can be a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning method to denoise the additive noise-corrupted autoregressive model. Our approach is motivated by recent work in computer vision and does not require full knowledge of the noise distribution. We use the proposed method to recover exemplary finite- and infinite-variance autoregressive signals, namely, Gaussian- and alpha-stable distributed signals, respectively, from their noise-corrupted versions. The simulation study conducted on both synthetic and semi-synthetic data demonstrates the efficiency of our method compared to several baseline methods, particularly when the corruption is significant and impulsive in nature. Finally, we apply the presented methodology to forecast the pure autoregressive signal from the noise-corrupted data.</p></details> | 32 pages, 17 figures |

Unlike existing approaches, we do not rely on fixed historical windows and handcrafted features, but rather encode the entire recent possession, thereby avoiding the inclusion of potentially irrelevant or misleading historical information. Path signatures naturally capture the order and interaction of events, providing a mathematically grounded feature encoding for variable-length time series of irregular sampling frequencies without the necessity for manual feature engineering. Our proposed approach outperforms a transformer-based benchmark across various loss metrics and considerably reduces computational cost. Building on these results, we introduce a new possession evaluation metric based on well-established frameworks in soccer analytics, incorporating both predicted action type probabilities and action location. Our metric shows greater reliability than existing metrics in domain-specific comparisons. Finally, we validate our approach through a detailed analysis of the 2017/18 Premier League season and discuss further applications and future extensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Approach for Estimating Largest Lyapunov Exponents in One-Dimensional Chaotic Time Series Using Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04868v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and quantifying chaos from data remains challenging. We present a data-driven method for estimating the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) from one-dimensional chaotic time series using machine learning. A predictor is trained to produce out-of-sample, multi-horizon forecasts; the LLE is then inferred from the exponential growth of the geometrically averaged forecast error (GMAE) across the horizon, which serves as a proxy for trajectory divergence. We validate the approach on four canonical 1D maps-logistic, sine, cubic, and Chebyshev-achieving R2pos > 0.99 against reference LLE curves with series as short as M = 450. Among baselines, KNN yields the closest fits (KNN-R comparable; RF larger deviations). By design the estimator targets positive exponents: in periodic/stable regimes it returns values indistinguishable from zero. Noise robustness is assessed by adding zero-mean white measurement noise and summarizing performance versus the average SNR over parameter sweeps: accuracy saturates for SNRm > 30 dB and collapses below 27 dB, a conservative sensor-level benchmark. The method is simple, computationally efficient, and model-agnostic, requiring only stationarity and the presence of a dominant positive exponent. It offers a practical route to LLE estimation in experimental settings where only scalar time-series measurements are available, with extensions to higher-dimensional and irregularly sampled data left for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 2 Tables, 14 Equations</p></details> |

Often, as grand-averaging techniques a priori assume normally-distributed parameters and linear, stationary processes in biorhythmic, time series data, important information is lost, averaged out as gross data. We developed an affective computing platform that enables taking brief data samples while maintaining personalized statistical power. This is achieved by combining a new data type derived from the micropeaks present in time series data registered from brief (5-second-long) face videos with recent advances in AI-driven face-grid estimation methods. By adopting geometric and nonlinear dynamical systems approaches to analyze the kinematics, especially the speed data, the new methods capture all facial micropeaks. These include as well the nuances of different affective micro expressions.

However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation (OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA) hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers, enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF) Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient spatial-temporal modeling.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Not surprisingly, many forecasting methods are being proposed. To ensure progress, it is essential to be able to study and compare such methods empirically in a comprehensive and reliable manner. To achieve this, we propose TFB, an automated benchmark for Time Series Forecasting (TSF) methods. TFB advances the state-of-the-art by addressing shortcomings related to datasets, comparison methods, and evaluation pipelines: 1) insufficient coverage of data domains, 2) stereotype bias against traditional methods, and 3) inconsistent and inflexible pipelines. To achieve better domain coverage, we include datasets from 10 different domains: traffic, electricity, energy, the environment, nature, economic, stock markets, banking, health, and the web. We also provide a time series characterization to ensure that the selected datasets are comprehensive. To remove biases against some methods, we include a diverse range of methods, including statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning methods, and we also support a variety of evaluation strategies and metrics to ensure a more comprehensive evaluations of different methods. To support the integration of different methods into the benchmark and enable fair comparisons, TFB features a flexible and scalable pipeline that eliminates biases. Next, we employ TFB to perform a thorough evaluation of 21 Univariate Time Series Forecasting (UTSF) methods on 8,068 univariate time series and 14 Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) methods on 25 datasets.

When expensive high-dimensional dynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic loss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative, history-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics from time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework using the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by construction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium statistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before specializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable for entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning strategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on benchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1) coarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while preserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed video of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local rearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics. We provide open-source implementations in both PyTorch and LAMMPS, enabling large-scale inference and extensibility to diverse particle-based systems.</p></details> | 34 pages, 12 figures |

A carefully chosen set of identification conditions for the common component and the potentially nonstationary main effects is proposed to strengthen the interpretations of sparse main effects, while estimators of all model components are presented. Sparse estimation of the latent main effects is proposed using a doubly adaptive fused lasso estimation to allow for sparse sub-block detection, with theoretical guarantees and rates of convergence spelt out for the final estimators. Sparse block consistency for the main effects is also proved as a result. A realized Mallow's $C_p$ is developed for tuning parameter selection, with practical implementation described. Simulation experiments are performed under a variety of settings, showing our proposed estimators work well. A set of NYC taxi traffic data is analyzed, clearly showing the effects of Covid-19 lockdown, with prolonged sparse main effects detected.</p></details> | 43 pages, 7 figures |

They are also becoming increasingly complex, with recent trends indicating larger datasets, longer time series, and multi-modal integrations. Transformers, which have rapidly gained popularity due to their success in natural language processing and other domains, are well-suited to address these challenges due to their ability to model long-range dependencies and process data in parallel. But their application to EHR classification remains limited by data representations, which can reduce performance or fail to capture informative missingness. In this paper, we present the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), which attends to both the clinical variable and time point axes of EHR data to learn richer data relationships and address the difficulties of data sparsity. BAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on sepsis prediction and is competitive to top methods for mortality classification. In comparison to other transformers, BAT demonstrates increased robustness to data missingness, and learns unique sensor embeddings which can be used in transfer learning. Baseline models, which were previously located across multiple repositories or utilized deprecated libraries, were re-implemented with PyTorch and made available for reproduction and future benchmarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Interpreting Time Series Forecasts with LIME and SHAP: A Case Study on the Air Passengers Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12253v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting underpins critical decisions across aviation, energy, retail and health. Classical autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models offer interpretability via coefficients but struggle with nonlinearities, whereas tree-based machine-learning models such as XGBoost deliver high accuracy but are often opaque. This paper presents a unified framework for interpreting time-series forecasts using local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and SHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP). We convert a univariate series into a leakage-free supervised learning problem, train a gradient-boosted tree alongside an ARIMA baseline and apply post-hoc explainability. Using the Air Passengers dataset as a case study, we show that a small set of lagged features -- particularly the twelve-month lag -- and seasonal encodings explain most forecast variance.

The long-term spatio-temporal dependency learning brings two new challenges: 1) The long-term temporal sequence includes multiscale information naturally which is hard to extract efficiently; 2) The multiscale temporal information from different nodes is highly correlated and hard to model. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM2) that includes a multiscale Mamba architecture to capture the multiscale information efficiently and simultaneously, and an adaptive graph causal convolution network to learn the complex multiscale spatio-temporal dependency. STM2 includes hierarchical information aggregation for different-scale information that guarantees their distinguishability. To capture diverse temporal dynamics across all spatial nodes more efficiently, we further propose an enhanced version termed \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ixture of \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM3) that employs a special Mixture-of-Experts architecture, including a more stable routing strategy and a causal contrastive learning strategy to enhance the scale distinguishability. We prove that STM3 has much better routing smoothness and guarantees the pattern disentanglement for each expert successfully. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate STM2/STM3's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in long-term spatio-temporal time-series prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedSpaformer: a Transferable Transformer with Multi-granularity Token Sparsification for Medical Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15578v3)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate medical time series (MedTS) classification is essential for effective clinical diagnosis, yet remains challenging due to complex multi-channel temporal dependencies, information redundancy, and label scarcity. While transformer-based models have shown promise in time series analysis, most are designed for forecasting tasks and fail to fully exploit the unique characteristics of MedTS. In this paper, we introduce MedSpaformer, a transformer-based framework tailored for MedTS classification. It incorporates a sparse token-based dual-attention mechanism that enables global context modeling and token sparsification, allowing dynamic feature refinement by focusing on informative tokens while reducing redundancy. This mechanism is integrated into a multi-granularity cross-channel encoding scheme to capture intra- and inter-granularity temporal dependencies and inter-channel correlations, enabling progressive refinement of task-relevant patterns in medical signals. The sparsification design allows our model to flexibly accommodate inputs with variable lengths and channel dimensions. We also introduce an adaptive label encoder to extract label semantics and address cross-dataset label space misalignment. Together, these components enhance the model's transferability across heterogeneous medical datasets, which helps alleviate the challenge of label scarcity. Our model outperforms 13 baselines across 7 medical datasets under supervised learning. It also excels in few-shot learning and demonstrates zero-shot capability in both in-domain and cross-domain diagnostics. These results highlight MedSpaformer's robustness and its potential as a unified solution for MedTS classification across diverse settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 fig...</summary><p>4 figures, 9 pages, 4 tables</p></details> |

PanelMatch is an R package that implements a set of tools enabling researchers to apply matching methods for causal inference with time-series cross-sectional data. Relative to other commonly used methods for longitudinal analyses, like regression with fixed effects, the matching-based approach implemented in PanelMatch makes fewer parametric assumptions and offers more diagnostics. In this paper, we discuss the PanelMatch package, showing users a recommended pipeline for doing causal inference analysis with it and highlighting useful diagnostic and visualization tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Gaussian Processes with Latent Kronecker Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06895v2)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applying Gaussian processes (GPs) to very large datasets remains a challenge due to limited computational scalability. Matrix structures, such as the Kronecker product, can accelerate operations significantly, but their application commonly entails approximations or unrealistic assumptions. In particular, the most common path to creating a Kronecker-structured kernel matrix is by evaluating a product kernel on gridded inputs that can be expressed as a Cartesian product. However, this structure is lost if any observation is missing, breaking the Cartesian product structure, which frequently occurs in real-world data such as time series. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging latent Kronecker structure, by expressing the kernel matrix of observed values as the projection of a latent Kronecker product. In combination with iterative linear system solvers and pathwise conditioning, our method facilitates inference of exact GPs while requiring substantially fewer computational resources than standard iterative methods. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art sparse and variational GPs on real-world datasets with up to five million examples, including robotics, automated machine learning, and climate applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Machine Learning 2025</p></details> |

Sufficient conditions for asymptotic equicontinuity are provided for nonstationary arrays of time series. This yields comprehensive general results that are applicable to various notions of dependence, which is exemplified in detail for nonstationary $\alpha$-mixing series. Especially, we obtain the weak convergence of the sequential process under essentially the same mild assumptions as known for the classical empirical process. Core ingredients of the proofs are a novel maximal inequality for nonmeasurable stochastic processes, uniform chaining arguments and, for the set-indexed smoothed process, uniform Lipschitz properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniCast: A Unified Multimodal Prompting Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11954v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is a foundational task across domains, such as finance, healthcare, and environmental monitoring. While recent advances in Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated strong generalisation through large-scale pretraining, existing models operate predominantly in a unimodal setting, ignoring the rich multimodal context, such as visual and textual signals, that often accompanies time series data in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel parameter-efficient multimodal framework, UniCast, that extends TSFMs to jointly leverage time series, vision, and text modalities for enhanced forecasting performance. Our method integrates modality-specific embeddings from pretrained Vision and Text Encoders with a frozen TSFM via soft prompt tuning, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal parameter updates. This design not only preserves the generalisation strength of the foundation model but also enables effective cross-modal interaction. Extensive experiments across diverse time-series forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that UniCast consistently and significantly outperforms all existing TSFM baselines. The findings highlight the critical role of multimodal context in advancing the next generation of general-purpose time series forecasters.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Wavelet-Based Framework for Mapping Long Memory in Resting-State fMRI: Age-Related Changes in the Hippocampus from the ADHD-200 Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11920v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series are known to exhibit long-range temporal dependencies that challenge traditional modeling approaches. In this study, we propose a novel computational pipeline to characterize and interpret these dependencies using a long-memory (LM) framework, which captures the slow, power-law decay of autocorrelation in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) signals. The pipeline involves voxelwise estimation of LM parameters via a wavelet-based Bayesian method, yielding spatial maps that reflect temporal dependence across the brain. These maps are then projected onto a lower-dimensional space via a composite basis and are then related to individual-level covariates through group-level regression. We applied this approach to the ADHD-200 dataset and found significant positive associations between age in children and the LM parameter in the hippocampus, after adjusting for ADHD symptom severity and medication status. These findings complement prior neuroimaging work by linking long-range temporal dependence to developmental changes in memory-related brain regions. Overall, the proposed methodology enables detailed mapping of intrinsic temporal dynamics in rs-fMRI and offers new insights into the relationship between functional signal memory and brain development.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeSenCLIP: A Vision-Language Model for Remote Sensing Using Single-Pixel Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11919v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models have shown significant promise in remote sensing applications, particularly for land-use and land-cover (LULC) via zero-shot classification and retrieval. However, current approaches face two key challenges: reliance on large spatial tiles that increase computational cost, and dependence on text-based supervision, which is often not readily available. In this work, we present TimeSenCLIP, a lightweight framework that reevaluate the role of spatial context by evaluating the effectiveness of a single pixel by leveraging its temporal and spectral dimensions, for classifying LULC and ecosystem types. By leveraging spectral and temporal information from Sentinel-2 imagery and cross-view learning with geo-tagged ground-level photos, we minimises the need for caption-based training while preserving semantic alignment between overhead (satellite) and ground perspectives. Our approach is grounded in the LUCAS and Sen4Map datasets, and evaluated on classification tasks including LULC, crop type, and ecosystem type. We demonstrate that single pixel inputs, when combined with temporal and spectral cues, are sufficient for thematic mapping, offering a scalable and efficient alternative for large-scale remote sensing applications.

| **[Physics-Informed Diffusion Models for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11528v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a physics-informed diffusion model for multivariate time series data. Over the past years, diffusion model has demonstrated its effectiveness in forecasting, imputation, generation, and anomaly detection in the time series domain. In this paper, we present a new approach for learning the physics-dependent temporal distribution of multivariate time series data using a weighted physics-informed loss during diffusion model training. A weighted physics-informed loss is constructed using a static weight schedule. This approach enables a diffusion model to accurately approximate underlying data distribution, which can influence the unsupervised anomaly detection performance. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that physics-informed training improves the F1 score in anomaly detection; it generates better data diversity and log-likelihood. Our model outperforms baseline approaches, additionally, it surpasses prior physics-informed work and purely data-driven diffusion models on a synthetic dataset and one real-world dataset while remaining competitive on others.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[BRIEF: BRain-Inspired network connection search with Extensive temporal feature Fusion enhances disease classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11732v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing deep learning models for functional MRI-based classification have limitations in network architecture determination (relying on experience) and feature space fusion (mostly simple concatenation, lacking mutual learning). Inspired by the human brain's mechanism of updating neural connections through learning and decision-making, we proposed a novel BRain-Inspired feature Fusion (BRIEF) framework, which is able to optimize network architecture automatically by incorporating an improved neural network connection search (NCS) strategy and a Transformer-based multi-feature fusion module. Specifically, we first extracted 4 types of fMRI temporal representations, i.e., time series (TCs), static/dynamic functional connection (FNC/dFNC), and multi-scale dispersion entropy (MsDE), to construct four encoders. Within each encoder, we employed a modified Q-learning to dynamically optimize the NCS to extract high-level feature vectors, where the NCS is formulated as a Markov Decision Process. Then, all feature vectors were fused via a Transformer, leveraging both stable/time-varying connections and multi-scale dependencies across different brain regions to achieve the final classification. Additionally, an attention module was embedded to improve interpretability. The classification performance of our proposed BRIEF was compared with 21 state-of-the-art models by discriminating two mental disorders from healthy controls: schizophrenia (SZ, n=1100) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n=1550). BRIEF demonstrated significant improvements of 2.2% to 12.1% compared to 21 algorithms, reaching an AUC of 91.5% - 0.6% for SZ and 78.4% - 0.5% for ASD, respectively. This is the first attempt to incorporate a brain-inspired, reinforcement learning strategy to optimize fMRI-based mental disorder classification, showing significant potential for identifying precise neuroimaging biomarkers.</p></details> |  |

We here introduce infomeasure, an open-source Python package designed to provide robust tools for calculating a wide variety of information-theoretic measures, including entropies, mutual information, transfer entropy and divergences. It is designed for both discrete and continuous variables; implements state-of-the-art estimation techniques; and allows the calculation of local measure values, $p$-values and $t$-scores. By unifying these approaches under one consistent framework, infomeasure aims to mitigate common pitfalls, ensure reproducibility, and simplify the practical implementation of information-theoretic analyses. In this contribution, we explore the motivation and features of infomeasure; its validation, using known analytical solutions; and exemplify its utility in a case study involving the analysis of human brain time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, for documentation, see https://infomeasure.readthedocs.io/</p></details> |

However, the effectiveness of these efforts is often self-reported by project developers, or certified through processes with limited external validation. This leads to concerns about data reliability and project integrity. In response to increasing scrutiny of voluntary carbon markets, this study presents a dataset on global afforestation and reforestation efforts compiled from primary (meta-)information and augmented with time-series satellite imagery and other secondary data. Our dataset covers 1,289,068 planting sites from 45,628 projects spanning 33 years. Since any remote sensing-based validation effort relies on the integrity of a planting site's geographic boundary, this dataset introduces a standardized assessment of the provided site-level location information, which we summarize in one easy-to-communicate key indicator: LDIS -- the Location Data Integrity Score. We find that approximately 79\% of the georeferenced planting sites monitored fail on at least 1 out of 10 LDIS indicators, while 15\% of the monitored projects lack machine-readable georeferenced data in the first place. In addition to enhancing accountability in the voluntary carbon market, the presented dataset also holds value as training data for e.g. computer vision-related tasks with millions of linked Sentinel-2 and Planetscope satellite images.</p></details> | 10 figures |

The framework is built upon Large Language Models (LLMs), incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowered by Agentic AI and integrated with a UAV-specific knowledge base. Through the Agentic RAG, the LLM autonomously interprets high-level task requirements and identifies the key components necessary for trajectory optimization, including model inputs and outputs, network architecture, reward functions, and task constraints. To support efficient modeling across different system scales, we introduce the Mamba-Attention Integrated Transformer (MAIT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines the long-range dependency modeling capability of attention mechanisms with the efficient temporal dynamic representation of Mamba. Furthermore, a Trajectory-Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) method is proposed to achieve unified policy gradient optimization in both discrete and continuous trajectory spaces for MAIT training. Extensive experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ARMAIT framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniCache: A Trajectory-Oriented Global Perspective on Training-Free Cache Reuse for Diffusion Transformer Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16212v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process. Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

While general-purpose deep research agents have shown impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored for medical contexts. We present a medical deep research agent that addresses these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool interactions. Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG) representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF) design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups, and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving high fidelity along the original trajectory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrated Take-off Management and Trajectory Optimization for Merging Control in Urban Air Mobility Corridors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15395v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has the potential to revolutionize daily transportation, offering rapid and efficient aerial mobility services. Take-off and merging phases are critical for air corridor operations, requiring the coordination of take-off aircraft and corridor traffic while ensuring safety and seamless transition. This paper proposes an integrated take-off management and trajectory optimization for merging control in UAM corridors. We first introduce a novel take-off airspace design. To our knowledge, this paper is one of the first to propose a structured design for take-off airspace. Based on the take-off airspace design, we devise a hierarchical coordinated take-off and merging management (HCTMM) strategy. To be specific, the take-off airspace design can simplify aircraft dynamics and thus reduce the dimensionality of the trajectory optimization problem whilst mitigating obstacle avoidance complexities. The HCTMM strategy strictly ensures safety and improves the efficiency of take-off and merging operations. At the tactical level, a scheduling algorithm coordinates aircraft take-off times and selects dynamic merging points to reduce conflicts and ensure smooth take-off and merging processes. At the operational level, a trajectory optimization strategy ensures that each aircraft reaches the dynamic merging point efficiently while satisfying safety constraints. Simulation results show that, compared to representative strategies with fixed or dynamic merging points, the HCTMM strategy significantly improves operational efficiency and reduces computational burden, while ensuring safety under various corridor traffic conditions. Further results confirm the scalability of the HCTMM strategy and the computational efficiency enabled by the proposed take-off airspace design.</p></details> | 31 pages |
| **[SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02085v4)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/JARVIS-Xs/SE-Agent.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided hierarchical planning framework for robust spatial-temporal obstacle avoidance. In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance and fast parallel computation. Furthermore, an incremental multi-branch trajectory management framework is introduced to enable spatio-temporal topological decision-making, while efficiently leveraging historical information to reduce replanning time. Simulation results show that TRUST-Planner outperforms baseline competitors, achieving a 96\% success rate and millisecond-level computation efficiency in tested complex environments. Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Even though most traffic accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention, as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions -- and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.</p></details> |  |

Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and most existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by UAI 2025.

The objective is to assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the reliability of the approaches. While previous VTP models overlook the specific traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be guaranteed. These findings can inform the development of more reliable vessel trajectory prediction approaches, enhancing safety and efficiency in future inland waterways navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |

The deep Koopman operator is trained on sampled flight data to construct a high-dimensional latent representation in which the nonlinear quadrotor dynamics are approximated by linear models. This linearization enables the application of MPC to efficiently optimize control actions over a finite prediction horizon, ensuring accurate trajectory tracking and stabilization. The proposed DK-MPC approach is validated through a series of trajectory-following and point-stabilization numerical experiments, where it demonstrates superior tracking accuracy and significantly lower computation time compared to conventional nonlinear MPC.

| **[Hybrid Machine Learning Model with a Constrained Action Space for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03666v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial to advance autonomous driving, improving safety, and efficiency. Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world Argoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark comparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2025 IEEE.

| **[Rapid Urban Visibility Hotspots: Quantifying Building Vertex Visibility from Connected Vehicle Trajectories using Spatial Indexing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03365v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective placement of Out-of-Home advertising and street furniture requires accurate identification of locations offering maximum visual exposure to target audiences, particularly vehicular traffic. Traditional site selection methods often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity) radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings: 1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots' receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2) The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Tube Visualization of Particle Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13505v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel, computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROVER: Robust Loop Closure Verification with Trajectory Prior in Repetitive Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13488v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes, achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity. Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter, we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are available at https://github.com/jarvisyjw/ROVER.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

While these trajectories reflect inherent uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. By introducing a novel online update step and an optimization step that captures inter-step dependencies, our method can produce discontinuous prediction intervals around each trajectory, naturally capture temporal dependencies, and yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRAP: Robot Sub-Trajectory Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15182v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning is witnessing a significant increase in the size, diversity, and complexity of pre-collected datasets, mirroring trends in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Many robot learning methods treat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task, generalist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the "sub"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve sub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion. STRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning methods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much larger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn robust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at https://weirdlabuw.github.io/strap/</p></details> |

We study generative modeling for planning with datasets repurposed from offline reinforcement learning. Specifically, we identify temporal consistency in the absence of step-wise rewards as one key technical challenge. We introduce the Latent Plan Transformer (LPT), a novel model that leverages a latent variable to connect a Transformer-based trajectory generator and the final return. LPT can be learned with maximum likelihood estimation on trajectory-return pairs. In learning, posterior sampling of the latent variable naturally integrates sub-trajectories to form a consistent abstraction despite the finite context. At test time, the latent variable is inferred from an expected return before policy execution, realizing the idea of planning as inference. Our experiments demonstrate that LPT can discover improved decisions from sub-optimal trajectories, achieving competitive performance across several benchmarks, including Gym-Mujoco, Franka Kitchen, Maze2D, and Connect Four. It exhibits capabilities in nuanced credit assignments, trajectory stitching, and adaptation to environmental contingencies. These results validate that latent variable inference can be a strong alternative to step-wise reward prompting.</p></details> |  |

Predicting and managing oil spill trajectories is highly complex, due to the interplay of physical, chemical, and environmental factors such as wind, currents, and temperature, which makes timely and effective response challenging. Accurate real-time trajectory forecasting and coordinated mitigation are vital for minimizing the impact of these disasters. This study introduces an integrated framework combining a multi-agent swarm robotics system built on the MOOS-IvP platform with Liquid Time-Constant Neural Networks (LTCNs). The proposed system fuses adaptive machine learning with autonomous marine robotics, enabling real-time prediction, dynamic tracking, and rapid response to evolving oil spills. By leveraging LTCNs--well-suited for modeling complex, time-dependent processes--the framework achieves real-time, high-accuracy forecasts of spill movement. Swarm intelligence enables decentralized, scalable, and resilient decision-making among robot agents, enhancing collective monitoring and containment efforts. Our approach was validated using data from the Deepwater Horizon spill, where the LTC-RK4 model achieved 0.96 spatial accuracy, surpassing LSTM approaches by 23%. The integration of advanced neural modeling with autonomous, coordinated robotics demonstrates substantial improvements in prediction precision, flexibility, and operational scalability. Ultimately, this research advances the state-of-the-art for sustainable, autonomous oil spill management and environmental protection by enhancing both trajectory prediction and response coordination.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 40 figures.

| **[Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion: Real-Time Trajectory Planning with Just-Enough Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12166v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots equipped with rich sensor suites can localize reliably in partially-observable environments, but powering every sensor continuously is wasteful and often infeasible. Belief-space planners address this by propagating pose-belief covariance through analytic models and switching sensors heuristically--a brittle, runtime-expensive approach. Data-driven approaches--including diffusion models--learn multi-modal trajectories from demonstrations, but presuppose an accurate, always-on state estimate. We address the largely open problem: for a given task in a mapped environment, which \textit{minimal sensor subset} must be active at each location to maintain state uncertainty \textit{just low enough} to complete the task? Our key insight is that when a diffusion planner is explicitly conditioned on a pose-belief raster and a sensor mask, the spread of its denoising trajectories yields a calibrated, differentiable proxy for the expected localisation error. Building on this insight, we present Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion (B-COD), the first planner that, in a 10 ms forward pass, returns a short-horizon trajectory, per-waypoint aleatoric variances, and a proxy for localisation error--eliminating external covariance rollouts. We show that this single proxy suffices for a soft-actor-critic to choose sensors online, optimising energy while bounding pose-covariance growth. We deploy B-COD in real-time marine trials on an unmanned surface vehicle and show that it reduces sensing energy consumption while matching the goal-reach performance of an always-on baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025 (Conference on Robot Learning)</p></details> |
| **[FSDP: Fast and Safe Data-Driven Overtaking Trajectory Planning for Head-to-Head Autonomous Racing Competitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06075v2)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating overtaking trajectories in autonomous racing is a challenging task, as the trajectory must satisfy the vehicle's dynamics and ensure safety and real-time performance running on resource-constrained hardware. This work proposes the Fast and Safe Data-Driven Planner to address this challenge. Sparse Gaussian predictions are introduced to improve both the computational efficiency and accuracy of opponent predictions. Furthermore, the proposed approach employs a bi-level quadratic programming framework to generate an overtaking trajectory leveraging the opponent predictions. The first level uses polynomial fitting to generate a rough trajectory, from which reference states and control inputs are derived for the second level. The second level formulates a model predictive control optimization problem in the Frenet frame, generating a trajectory that satisfies both kinematic feasibility and safety. Experimental results on the F1TENTH platform show that our method outperforms the State-of-the-Art, achieving an 8.93% higher overtaking success rate, allowing the maximum opponent speed, ensuring a smoother ego trajectory, and reducing 74.04% computational time compared to the Predictive Spliner method.

| **[On Delta-Homology Analogy: Memory as Structured Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04203v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the \emph{delta-homology analogy}, which formalizes memory as a set of sparse, topologically irreducible attractors. A \emph{Dirac delta-like memory trace} \( \delta_\gamma \) is identified with a nontrivial homology generator \( [\gamma] \in H_1(\mathcal{Z}) \) on a latent manifold of cognitive states. Such traces are sharply localized along reproducible topological cycles and are only activated when inference trajectories complete a full cycle. They encode minimal, path-dependent memory units that cannot be synthesized from local features alone. Based on the analogy, we propose a topological framework for memory and inference grounded in the structure of spike-timing dynamics and persistent homology. Starting from the observation that polychronous neural groups (PNGs) encode reproducible, time-locked spike sequences shaped by axonal delays and synaptic plasticity, we construct \emph{spatiotemporal complexes} whose temporally consistent transitions define chain complexes over which robust activation cycles emerge. These activation loops are abstracted into \emph{cell posets}, enabling a compact and causally ordered representation of neural activity with overlapping and compositional memory traces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-Impulse Trajectory Design in Two-Body Systems With Riemannian Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11612v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a new method for generating impulsive trajectories in restricted two-body systems by leveraging Riemannian geometry. The proposed method transforms the standard trajectory optimization problem into a purely geometric one that involves computing a set of geodesics for a suitable Riemannian metric. This transformation is achieved by defining a metric, specifically the Jacobi metric, that embeds the dynamics directly into the metric, so any geodesic of the metric is also a dynamically feasible trajectory. The method finds the fuel-optimal transfer trajectory by sampling candidate energy ($\Delta V$) changes for different points on the current and desired orbit, and efficiently computing and evaluating each candidate geodesic, which are equivalent to candidate orbit transfer trajectories via the Jacobi metric. The method bypasses the known issues of optimization-based methods, e.g., sensitivity to the initial guess, and can be applied to more complex two-body systems. The approach is demonstrated on the minimum-$\Delta V$ two-impulse phase-free orbit transfer problem, first on a Keplerian system and second on a system with a modeled $J_2$ perturbation. The proposed method is shown to meet or exceed the state-of-the-art methods in the minimum-$\Delta V$ problem in the Keplerian system. The generality and versatility of the approach is demonstrated by seamlessly including the $J_2$ perturbation, a case that many existing methods cannot handle. Numerical simulations and performance comparisons showcase the effectiveness of the approach.</p></details> |  |

Despite the growing interest and efforts in this field, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2) lack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for sufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a trajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies. TrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation Network (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data preprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports broadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to learn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet learns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual features with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive loss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an unsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video datasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e., soccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e., sports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results demonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video retrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in action spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action categories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning. Additionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications based on TrajSV.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by TCSVT</p></details> |

Existing methods encode map and agent positions and decode future trajectories in Cartesian coordinates. However, modeling the relationships between the ego vehicle and surrounding traffic elements in Cartesian space can be suboptimal, as it does not naturally capture the varying influence of different elements based on their relative distances and directions. To address this limitation, we adopt the Polar coordinate system, where positions are represented by radius and angle. This representation provides a more intuitive and effective way to model spatial changes and relative relationships, especially in terms of distance and directional influence. Based on this insight, we propose Polaris, a novel method that operates entirely in Polar coordinates, distinguishing itself from conventional Cartesian-based approaches. By leveraging the Polar representation, this method explicitly models distance and direction variations and captures relative relationships through dedicated encoding and refinement modules, enabling more structured and spatially aware trajectory prediction and planning. Extensive experiments on the challenging prediction (Argoverse 2) and planning benchmarks (nuPlan) demonstrate that Polaris achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[KDPE: A Kernel Density Estimation Strategy for Diffusion Policy Trajectory Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10511v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning robot policies that capture multimodality in the training data has been a long-standing open challenge for behavior cloning. Recent approaches tackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with generative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on a diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories. While achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that may lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First, the stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of generated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach, it can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training. Recent work focuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy either with large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms. Instead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that filters out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while keeping a low test-time computational overhead. For Kernel Density Estimation, we propose a manifold-aware kernel to model a probability density function for actions composed of end-effector Cartesian position, orientation, and gripper state. KDPE overall achieves better performance than Diffusion Policy on simulated single-arm tasks and real robot experiments.

This phenomena diminishes utility in production applications that repeatedly rely on common prompt templates or applications that frequently rely on LLMs for specific tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, language translation). Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that LLMs still tend to refuse responses to harmful instructions when those instructions are reframed to appear as benign tasks. Our mechanistic analysis reveal that LLMs follow distinct "constellation" patterns in embedding space as representations traverse layers, with each task maintaining consistent trajectories that shift predictably between refusal and non-refusal cases. We introduce SafeConstellations, an inference-time trajectory-shifting approach that tracks task-specific trajectory patterns and guides representations toward non-refusal pathways. By selectively guiding model behavior only on tasks prone to over-refusal, and by preserving general model behavior, our method reduces over-refusal rates by up to 73% with minimal impact on utility-offering a principled approach to mitigating over-refusals.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, existing fault-tolerant control methods exhibit significant oscillations during docking and separation, impacting system stability. To address this issue, we propose a novel fault-tolerant control reallocation method that adapts to an arbitrary number of modular robots and their assembly formations. The algorithm redistributes the expected collective force and torque required for MARS to individual units according to their moment arm relative to the center of MARS mass. Furthermore, we propose an agile trajectory planning method for MARS of arbitrary configurations, which is collision-avoiding and dynamically feasible. Our work represents the first comprehensive approach to enable fault-tolerant and collision avoidance flight for MARS. We validate our method through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved fault tolerance, enhanced trajectory tracking accuracy, and greater robustness in cluttered environments.

Furthermore, we incorporate a custom-built asset derived from OpenStreetMap, enabling this approach to be smoothly applied in any geographic region covered by OpenStreetMap's road network. These advancements preserve the core strengths of the original algorithm while significantly extending its applicability to diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, a key challenge in such approaches lies in selecting an appropriate masking strategy. Previous studies have explored predefined masking techniques, including random and tube-based masking, as well as approaches that leverage key motion priors, optical flow and semantic cues from externally pre-trained models. In this work, we introduce a novel and generalizable Trajectory-Aware Adaptive Token Sampler (TATS), which models the motion dynamics of tokens and can be seamlessly integrated into the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework to select motion-centric tokens in videos. Additionally, we propose a unified training strategy that enables joint optimization of both MAE and TATS from scratch using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We show that our model allows for aggressive masking without compromising performance on the downstream task of action recognition while also ensuring that the pre-training remains memory efficient. Extensive experiments of the proposed approach across four benchmarks, including Something-Something v2, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, generalization, and efficiency of our work compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICCVW 2025 - Long Multi-Scene Video Foundations Workshop</p></details> |

To improve data quality with sparse trajectories as input, we systematically study two related research problems: trajectory recovery on road network, which aims to infer missing points to recover high-sampling trajectories, and map matching, which aims to map GPS points to road segments to determine underlying routes. In this paper, we present efficient methods TRMMA and MMA for accurate trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, where MMA serves as the first step of TRMMA. In MMA, we carefully formulate a classification task to map a GPS point from sparse trajectories to a road segment over a small candidate segment set, rather than the entire road network. We develop techniques in MMA to generate effective embeddings that capture the patterns of GPS data, directional information, and road segments, to accurately align sparse trajectories to routes. For trajectory recovery, TRMMA focuses on the segments in the route returned by MMA to infer missing points with position ratios on road segments, producing high-sampling trajectories efficiently by avoiding evaluation of all road segments. Specifically, in TRMMA, we design a dual-transformer encoding process to cohesively capture latent patterns in trajectories and routes, and an effective decoding technique to sequentially predict the position ratios and road segments of missing points. We conduct extensive experiments to compare TRMMA and MMA with numerous existing methods for trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, on 4 large real-world datasets. TRMMA and MMA consistently achieve the best result quality, often by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by 2025 IEEE 41st International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory-aware Shifted State Space Models for Online Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10453v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs (TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation. Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will be available at https://github.com.</p></details> |  |

However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness control mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.

| **[ParkDiffusion: Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Multi-Modal Trajectory Prediction for Automated Parking using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00586v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated parking is a critical feature of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), where accurate trajectory prediction is essential to bridge perception and planning modules. Despite its significance, research in this domain remains relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories, incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories. We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming existing methods by a considerable margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>IROS ...</summary><p>IROS 2025 Camera-Ready Version</p></details> |
| **[Counting Short Trajectories in Elementary Cellular Automata using the Transfer Matrix Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09768v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elementary Cellular Automata (ECAs) exhibit diverse behaviours often categorized by Wolfram's qualitative classification. To provide a quantitative basis for understanding these behaviours, we investigate the global dynamics of such automata and we describe a method that allows us to compute the number of all configurations leading to short attractors in a limited number of time steps. This computation yields exact results in the thermodynamic limit (as the CA grid size grows to infinity), and is based on the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) that we adapt for our purposes. Specifically, given two parameters $(p, c)$ we are able to compute the entropy of all initial configurations converging to an attractor of size $c$ after $p$ time-steps. By calculating such statistics for various ECA rules, we establish a quantitative connection between the entropy and the qualitative Wolfram classification scheme. Class 1 rules rapidly converge to maximal entropy for stationary states ($c=1$) as $p$ increases. Class 2 rules also approach maximal entropy quickly for appropriate cycle lengths $c$, potentially requiring consideration of translations. Class 3 rules exhibit zero or low finite entropy that saturates after a short transient. Class 4 rules show finite positive entropy, similar to some Class 3 rules. This method provides a precise framework for quantifying trajectory statistics, although its exponential computational cost in $p+c$ restricts practical analysis to short trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, accepted to ALife 2025</p></details> |

The deformability of garments leads to a vast state space and complex dynamics, which complicates precise and fine-grained manipulation. Previous approaches often rely on predefined key points or demonstrations, limiting their generalization across diverse garment categories. This paper presents a framework, MetaFold, that disentangles task planning from action prediction, learning each independently to enhance model generalization. It employs language-guided point cloud trajectory generation for task planning and a low-level foundation model for action prediction. This structure facilitates multi-category learning, enabling the model to adapt flexibly to various user instructions and folding tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework. Supplementary materials are available on our website: https://meta-fold.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTPO: Trajectory-Based Policy Optimization in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03772v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents ESCoT, an enhanced step-based coordinate trajectory planning method for multiple car-like robots. ESCoT incorporates two key strategies: collaborative planning for local robot groups and replanning for duplicate configurations. These strategies effectively enhance the performance of step-based MVTP methods. Through extensive experiments, we show that ESCoT 1) in sparse scenarios, significantly improves solution quality compared to baseline step-based method, achieving up to 70% improvement in typical conflict scenarios and 34% in randomly generated scenarios, while maintaining high solving efficiency; and 2) in dense scenarios, outperforms all baseline methods, maintains a success rate of over 50% even in the most challenging configurations. The results demonstrate that ESCoT effectively solves MVTP, further extending the capabilities of step-based methods. Finally, practical robot tests validate the algorithm's applicability in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, it has seen limited usage in spaceflight applications due to its heavy computational demands that exceed the capability of most flight computers. In this work, we provide results on the first flight demonstration of using machine learning-based warm starts for accelerating trajectory optimization for the Astrobee free-flying robot on-board the International Space Station (ISS). We formulate a data-driven optimal control approach that trains a neural network to learn the structure of the trajectory generation problem being solved for by sequential convex programming (SCP). On-board, this trained neural network predicts solutions for the trajectory generation problem and relies on using the SCP solver to enforce safety constraints for the system. Our trained network reduces the number of solver iterations required for convergence in cases including rotational dynamics by 60% and in cases with obstacles drawn from the training distribution of the warm start model by 50%. This work represents a significant milestone in the use of learning-based control for spaceflight applications and a stepping stone for future advances in the use of machine learning for autonomous guidance, navigation, & control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2025 International Conference on Space Robotics (iSpaRo).

In developing regions where access to multimodal data is limited, relying solely on onboard GPS data remains indispensable despite inherent challenges. To address this problem, we propose GSMT, a hybrid model that integrates a Graph Attention Network (GAT) with a sequence-to-sequence Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and incorporates a task corrector capable of extracting complex behavioral patterns from large-scale trajectory data. The task corrector clusters historical trajectories to identify distinct motion patterns and fine-tunes the predictions generated by the GAT and RNN. Specifically, GSMT fuses dynamic bus information and static station information through embedded hybrid networks to perform trajectory prediction, and applies the task corrector for secondary refinement after the initial predictions are generated. This two-stage approach enables multi-node trajectory prediction among buses operating in dense urban traffic environments under complex conditions. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance in both short-term and long-term trajectory prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ITSC 2025</p></details> |

When performing such structural edits, these methods either fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape replacement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage is available at https://follow-your-shape.github.io/</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we propose the Multidimensional Adaptive Coefficient (MAC), a plug-in module for flow and diffusion models that extends conventional unidimensional coefficients to multidimensional ones and enables inference trajectory-wise adaptation. MAC is trained via simulation-based feedback through adversarial refinement. Empirical results across diverse frameworks and datasets demonstrate that MAC enhances generative quality with high training efficiency. Consequently, our work offers a new perspective on inference trajectory optimality, encouraging future research to move beyond vector field design and to leverage training-efficient, simulation-based optimization.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Paper |
| **[Capsizing-Guided Trajectory Optimization for Autonomous Navigation with Rough Terrain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08108v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is a challenging task for ground robots to autonomously navigate in harsh environments due to the presence of non-trivial obstacles and uneven terrain. This requires trajectory planning that balances safety and efficiency. The primary challenge is to generate a feasible trajectory that prevents robot from tip-over while ensuring effective navigation. In this paper, we propose a capsizing-aware trajectory planner (CAP) to achieve trajectory planning on the uneven terrain. The tip-over stability of the robot on rough terrain is analyzed. Based on the tip-over stability, we define the traversable orientation, which indicates the safe range of robot orientations. This orientation is then incorporated into a capsizing-safety constraint for trajectory optimization. We employ a graph-based solver to compute a robust and feasible trajectory while adhering to the capsizing-safety constraint. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that CAP outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, providing enhanced navigation performance on uneven terrains.</p></details> |  |
| **[AIS-LLM: A Unified Framework for Maritime Trajectory Prediction, Anomaly Detection, and Collision Risk Assessment with Explainable Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07668v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increase in maritime traffic and the mandatory implementation of the Automatic Identification System (AIS), the importance and diversity of maritime traffic analysis tasks based on AIS data, such as vessel trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and collision risk assessment, is rapidly growing. However, existing approaches tend to address these tasks individually, making it difficult to holistically consider complex maritime situations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, AIS-LLM, which integrates time-series AIS data with a large language model (LLM). AIS-LLM consists of a Time-Series Encoder for processing AIS sequences, an LLM-based Prompt Encoder, a Cross-Modality Alignment Module for semantic alignment between time-series data and textual prompts, and an LLM-based Multi-Task Decoder. This architecture enables the simultaneous execution of three key tasks: trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and risk assessment of vessel collisions within a single end-to-end system. Experimental results demonstrate that AIS-LLM outperforms existing methods across individual tasks, validating its effectiveness. Furthermore, by integratively analyzing task outputs to generate situation summaries and briefings, AIS-LLM presents the potential for more intelligent and efficient maritime traffic management.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the use of sequential deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers, for real-time flock detection in multi-pedestrian trajectories. Our proposed approach consists of a two-stage process: first, a pre-trained binary classification model is used for pairwise trajectory classification, and second, the learned representations are applied to identify multi-agent flocks dynamically. We validate our method using real-world group movement datasets, demonstrating its robustness across varying sequence lengths and diverse movement patterns. Experimental results indicate that our model consistently detects pedestrian flocks with high accuracy and stability, even in dynamic and noisy environments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to identify other forms of collective motion, such as convoys and swarms, paving the way for more comprehensive multi-agent behavior analysis.</p></details> |  |

Traditional path planner, such as Artificial Potential Field (APF), offer computational efficiency but suffer from local minima issue due to position-based potential field functions and oscillatory motion near the obstacles due to Newtonian mechanics. To address this limitation, an Energy-based Artificial Potential Field (APF) framework is proposed in this paper that integrates position and velocity-dependent potential functions. E-APF ensures dynamic adaptability and mitigates local minima, enabling uninterrupted progression toward the goal. The proposed framework integrates E-APF with a hybrid trajectory optimizer that jointly minimizes jerk and execution time under velocity and acceleration constraints, ensuring geometric smoothness and time efficiency. The entire framework is validated in simulation using the 7-degree-of-freedom Kinova Gen3 robotic manipulator. The results demonstrate collision-free, smooth, time-efficient, and oscillation-free trajectory in the presence of obstacles, highlighting the efficacy of the combined trajectory optimization and real-time obstacle avoidance approach. This work lays the foundation for future integration with reactive control strategies and physical hardware deployment in real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Gaussian Representations with Motion Trajectory Field for Dynamic Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07182v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of novel-view synthesis and motion reconstruction of dynamic scenes from monocular video, which is critical for many robotic applications. Although Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable success in rendering static scenes, extending them to reconstruct dynamic scenes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that combines 3DGS with a motion trajectory field, enabling precise handling of complex object motions and achieving physically plausible motion trajectories. By decoupling dynamic objects from static background, our method compactly optimizes the motion trajectory field. The approach incorporates time-invariant motion coefficients and shared motion trajectory bases to capture intricate motion patterns while minimizing optimization complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in both novel-view synthesis and motion trajectory recovery from monocular video, advancing the capabilities of dynamic scene reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intention-Aware Diffusion Model for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07146v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for the path planning and motion control of autonomous vehicles. Recent diffusion-based models have shown promising results in capturing the inherent stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for trajectory prediction. However, the absence of explicit semantic modelling of pedestrian intent in many diffusion-based methods may result in misinterpreted behaviors and reduced prediction accuracy. To address the above challenges, we propose a diffusion-based pedestrian trajectory prediction framework that incorporates both short-term and long-term motion intentions. Short-term intent is modelled using a residual polar representation, which decouples direction and magnitude to capture fine-grained local motion patterns. Long-term intent is estimated through a learnable, token-based endpoint predictor that generates multiple candidate goals with associated probabilities, enabling multimodal and context-aware intention modelling. Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion process by incorporating adaptive guidance and a residual noise predictor that dynamically refines denoising accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated on the widely used ETH, UCY, and SDD benchmarks, demonstrating competitive results against state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

To interact effectively, robots must recognize the possible interaction modes and adapt to the one preferred by other agents. In this work, we propose MultiNash-PF, an efficient algorithm for capturing the multimodality in multi-agent interactions. We model interaction outcomes as equilibria of a game-theoretic planner, where each equilibrium corresponds to a distinct interaction mode. Our framework formulates interactive planning as Constrained Potential Trajectory Games (CPTGs), in which local Generalized Nash Equilibria (GNEs) represent plausible interaction outcomes. We propose to integrate the potential game approach with implicit particle filtering, a sample-efficient method for non-convex trajectory optimization. We utilize implicit particle filtering to identify the coarse estimates of multiple local minimizers of the game's potential function. MultiNash-PF then refines these estimates with optimization solvers, obtaining different local GNEs. We show through numerical simulations that MultiNash-PF reduces computation time by up to 50\% compared to a baseline. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in real-world human-robot interaction scenarios, where it successfully accounts for the multi-modal nature of interactions and resolves potential conflicts in real-time.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches treat detection and forecasting as separate sequential tasks, limiting their ability to leverage temporal cues. ForeSight addresses this limitation with a multi-task streaming and bidirectional learning approach, allowing detection and forecasting to share query memory and propagate information seamlessly. The forecast-aware detection transformer enhances spatial reasoning by integrating trajectory predictions from a multiple hypothesis forecast memory queue, while the streaming forecast transformer improves temporal consistency using past forecasts and refined detections. Unlike tracking-based methods, ForeSight eliminates the need for explicit object association, reducing error propagation with a tracking-free model that efficiently scales across multi-frame sequences. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that ForeSight achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving an EPA of 54.9%, surpassing previous methods by 9.3%, while also attaining the best mAP and minADE among multi-view detection and forecasting models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

This work evaluates the integration of a deep learning-based Social-Implicit (SI) pedestrian trajectory predictor within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework on the physical Continental Corriere robot. Tested across varied pedestrian densities, the SI-MPC system is compared to a traditional Constant Velocity (CV) model in both open-loop prediction and closed-loop navigation. Results show that SI improves trajectory prediction - reducing errors by up to 76% in low-density settings - and enhances safety and motion smoothness in crowded scenes. Moreover, real-world deployment reveals discrepancies between open-loop metrics and closed-loop performance, as the SI model yields broader, more cautious predictions. These findings emphasize the importance of system-level evaluation and highlight the SI-MPC framework's promise for safer, more adaptive navigation in dynamic, human-populated environments.</p></details> |  |

However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this, we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION dataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C reduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a task-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts.

Current approaches mainly rely on ID-based features and region-specific data to learn correlations between cell towers and roads, limiting their adaptability to unexplored areas. To enable high-accuracy CTMM without additional training in target regions, Zero-shot CTMM requires to extract not only region-adaptive features, but also sequential and location uncertainty to alleviate positioning errors in cellular data. In this paper, we propose a pixel-based trajectory calibration assistant for zero-shot CTMM, which takes advantage of transferable geospatial knowledge to calibrate pixelated trajectory, and then guide the path-finding process at the road network level. To enhance knowledge sharing across similar regions, a Gaussian mixture model is incorporated into VAE, enabling the identification of scenario-adaptive experts through soft clustering. To mitigate high positioning errors, a spatial-temporal awareness module is designed to capture sequential features and location uncertainty, thereby facilitating the inference of approximate user positions. Finally, a constrained path-finding algorithm is employed to reconstruct the road ID sequence, ensuring topological validity within the road network. This process is guided by the calibrated trajectory while optimizing for the shortest feasible path, thus minimizing unnecessary detours. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in zero-shot CTMM by 16.8\%.</p></details> |  |

An essentially equivalent viewpoint arises through stability analysis of a linear differential inclusion (LDI) encompassing the incremental behavior of the system. In this note, we use contraction tools to study the exponential stability of a system to a particular known trajectory, deriving a new LDI characterizing the error between arbitrary trajectories and this known trajectory. As with classical contraction analysis, this new inclusion is constructed via first partial derivatives of the system's vector field, and convergence rates are obtained with familiar tools: uniform bounding of the logarithmic norm and LMI-based Lyapunov conditions. Our LDI is guaranteed to outperform a usual contraction analysis in two special circumstances: i) when the bound on the logarithmic norm arises from an interval overapproximation of the Jacobian matrix, and ii) when the norm considered is the $\ell_1$ norm. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed approach strictly improves an existing framework for ellipsoidal reachable set computation.</p></details> |  |

While many distillation methods that are solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in few-step video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trustworthy Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction via Pattern-Aware Interaction Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13397v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable pedestrian trajectory prediction is critical for the safety and robustness of intelligent applications, yet achieving trustworthy prediction remains highly challenging due to the complexity of interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods often adopt black-box modeling of pedestrian interactions, treating all neighbors uniformly. Despite their strong performance, such opaque modeling limits the reliability of predictions in safety-critical real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns (e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training strategy, termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model not only outperforms recent black-box baselines in prediction accuracy, especially under high-density scenarios, but also provides stronger interpretability, achieving a favorable trade-off between reliability and accuracy. Furthermore, the SSOS strategy proves to be effective in improving sequential prediction performance, reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.</p></details> |  |

To enhance the robustness of trajectory planning under environmental disturbances, this paper presents a disturbance-aware planning framework that incorporates real-time disturbance estimation into both path searching and trajectory optimization. A key component of the framework is a disturbance-adaptive safety boundary adjustment mechanism, which dynamically modifies the vehicle's feasible dynamic boundaries based on estimated disturbances to ensure trajectory feasibility. Leveraging the dynamics model of the bimodal vehicle, the proposed approach achieves adaptive and reliable motion planning across different terrains and operating conditions. A series of real-world experiments and benchmark comparisons on a custom-built platform validate the effectiveness and robustness of the method, demonstrating improvements in tracking accuracy, task efficiency, and energy performance under both ground and aerial disturbances.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajEvo: Trajectory Prediction Heuristics Design via LLM-driven Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05616v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a critical task in modeling human behavior, especially in safety-critical domains such as social robotics and autonomous vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer improved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost, limited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose two key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population diversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and improve alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo outperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and notably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to an unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics. We release our source code to facilitate future research at https://github.com/ai4co/trajevo.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2505.04480</p></details> |

To address this critical gap, we introduce NaturalGAIA, a novel benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of agents, we developed LightManus, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. Our experiments reveal that NaturalGAIA presents a formidable challenge to current state-of-the-art LLMs; even the top-performing Claude-sonnet-4 achieved a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of only 34.6%. Moreover, while RFT substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR increased from 3.3% to 10.8%), its performance degraded sharply when handling complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception, decision-making, and execution. This research contributes a rigorous evaluation standard and a high-quality dataset to the community, aiming to guide the future development of GUI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Linear Parametric Map Modeling and Perception-aware Trajectory Planning for Mobile Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09340v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous navigation in mobile robots, reliant on perception and planning, faces major hurdles in large-scale, complex environments. These include heavy computational burdens for mapping, sensor occlusion failures for UAVs, and traversal challenges on irregular terrain for UGVs, all compounded by a lack of perception-aware strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce Random Mapping and Random Projection (RMRP). This method constructs a lightweight linear parametric map by first mapping data to a high-dimensional space, followed by a sparse random projection for dimensionality reduction. Our novel Residual Energy Preservation Theorem provides theoretical guarantees for this process, ensuring critical geometric properties are preserved. Based on this map, we propose the RPATR (Robust Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner) framework. For UAVs, our method unifies grid and Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) maps. The front-end uses an analytical occupancy gradient to refine initial paths for safety and smoothness, while the back-end uses a closed-form ESDF for trajectory optimization. Leveraging the trained RMRP model's generalization, the planner predicts unobserved areas for proactive navigation. For UGVs, the model characterizes terrain and provides closed-form gradients, enabling online planning to circumvent large holes. Validated in diverse scenarios, our framework demonstrates superior mapping performance in time, memory, and accuracy, and enables computationally efficient, safe navigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs. The code will be released to foster community collaboration.</p></details> |  |

It replaces the value function in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with group normalized rewards, while retaining PPO style token level importance sampling based on an old policy. We show that GRPO update rule in fact estimates the policy gradient at the old policy rather than the current one. However, since the old policy is refreshed every few steps, the discrepancy between the two remains small limiting the impact of this bias in practice. We validate this through an ablation study in which importance sampling is entirely removed, and updates are instead performed using the gradient estimated at a fixed old policy across multiple optimization steps. Remarkably, this simplification results in performance comparable to standard GRPO. Motivated by these findings, we propose a new algorithm: Trajectory level Importance Corrected GRPO (TIC GRPO). TIC GRPO replaces token level importance ratios with a single trajectory level probability ratio, yielding an unbiased estimate of the current policy gradient while preserving the critic free structure. Furthermore, we present the first theoretical convergence analysis for GRPO style methods, covering both the original GRPO and our proposed variant.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[DOTS: Learning to Reason Dynamically in LLMs via Optimal Reasoning Trajectories Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03864v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the capability of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning has gained significant attention in recent years. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of various prompting strategies in aiding LLMs in reasoning (called "reasoning actions"), such as step-by-step thinking, reflecting before answering, solving with programs, and their combinations. However, these approaches often applied static, predefined reasoning actions uniformly to all questions, without considering the specific characteristics of each question or the capability of the task-solving LLM. In this paper, we propose DOTS, an approach enabling LLMs to reason dynamically via optimal reasoning trajectory search, tailored to the specific characteristics of each question and the inherent capability of the task-solving LLM. Our approach involves three key steps: i) defining atomic reasoning action modules that can be composed into various reasoning action trajectories; ii) searching for the optimal action trajectory for each training question through iterative exploration and evaluation for the specific task-solving LLM; and iii) using the collected optimal trajectories to train an LLM to plan for the reasoning trajectories of unseen questions. In particular, we propose two learning paradigms, i.e., fine-tuning an external LLM as a planner to guide the task-solving LLM, or directly fine-tuning the task-solving LLM with an internalized capability for reasoning actions planning. Our experiments across eight reasoning tasks show that our method consistently outperforms static reasoning techniques and the vanilla instruction tuning approach. Further analysis reveals that our method enables LLMs to adjust their computation based on problem complexity, allocating deeper thinking and reasoning to harder problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

This paper proposes a hybrid trajectory planning framework that integrates the adaptability of learning-based methods with the formal safety guarantees of optimization-based approaches. The framework features a two-layer architecture: an upper layer employing a graph neural network (GNN) trained on real-world highway data to predict human-like longitudinal velocity profiles, and a lower layer utilizing path optimization formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. The primary contribution is the lower-layer path optimization model, which introduces a linear approximation of discretized vehicle geometry to substantially reduce computational complexity, while enforcing strict spatiotemporal non-overlapping constraints to formally guarantee collision avoidance throughout the planning horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that the planner generates highly smooth, collision-free trajectories in complex real-world emergency scenarios, achieving success rates exceeding 97% with average planning times of 54 ms, thereby confirming real-time capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intention Enhanced Diffusion Model for Multimodal Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04229v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for path planning and motion control of autonomous vehicles. However, accurately forecasting crowd trajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and uncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown promising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for trajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly incorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit the interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we propose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that incorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The motion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and a pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to effectively capture these intentions. Furthermore, we adopt an efficient guidance mechanism that facilitates the generation of interpretable trajectories. The proposed framework is evaluated on two widely used human trajectory prediction benchmarks, ETH and UCY, on which it is compared against state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at the 28th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), 2025</p></details> |

Most community models and datasets in the T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect, primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

While recent advances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action recognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points to track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a novel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational tokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling strategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and semantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that captures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action patterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with semantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information, achieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action recognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits), Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym.

This study presents an infrastructure-enabled proactive work zone safety warning system that leverages a Digital Twin environment, integrating real-time multi-sensor data, detailed High-Definition (HD) maps, and a historical prediction attention mechanism-based trajectory prediction model. Using a co-simulation environment that combines Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) and CAR Learning to Act (CARLA) simulators, along with Lanelet2 HD maps and the Historical Prediction Network (HPNet) model, we demonstrate effective trajectory prediction and early warning generation for vehicle interactions in freeway work zones. To evaluate the accuracy of predicted trajectories, we use two standard metrics: Joint Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Joint Final Displacement Error (FDE). Specifically, the infrastructure-enabled HPNet model demonstrates superior performance on the work-zone datasets generated from the co-simulation environment, achieving a minimum Joint FDE of 0.3228 meters and a minimum Joint ADE of 0.1327 meters, lower than the benchmarks on the Argoverse (minJointFDE: 1.0986 m, minJointADE: 0.7612 m) and Interaction (minJointFDE: 0.8231 m, minJointADE: 0.2548 m) datasets. In addition, our proactive safety warning generation application, utilizing vehicle bounding boxes and probabilistic conflict modeling, demonstrates its capability to issue alerts for potential vehicle conflicts.</p></details> |  |
| **[T-GVC: Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding at Ultra-Low Bitrates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07633v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging paradigm of generative video coding for Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging powerful generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or excessive dependence on high-level text guidance, which tend to inadequately capture fine-grained motion details, leading to unrealistic or incoherent reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding (dubbed T-GVC), a novel framework that bridges low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding. T-GVC features a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline that extracts pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic importance, significantly reducing the bitrate while preserving critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by integrating trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a training-free guidance mechanism in latent space to ensure physically plausible motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative models. Experimental results demonstrate that T-GVC outperforms both traditional and neural video codecs under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our framework achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided by geometric motion modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[WaMo: Wavelet-Enhanced Multi-Frequency Trajectory Analysis for Fine-Grained Text-Motion Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03343v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-Motion Retrieval (TMR) aims to retrieve 3D motion sequences semantically relevant to text descriptions. However, matching 3D motions with text remains highly challenging, primarily due to the intricate structure of human body and its spatial-temporal dynamics. Existing approaches often overlook these complexities, relying on general encoding methods that fail to distinguish different body parts and their dynamics, limiting precise semantic alignment. To address this, we propose WaMo, a novel wavelet-based multi-frequency feature extraction framework. It fully captures part-specific and time-varying motion details across multiple resolutions on body joints, extracting discriminative motion features to achieve fine-grained alignment with texts. WaMo has three key components: (1) Trajectory Wavelet Decomposition decomposes motion signals into frequency components that preserve both local kinematic details and global motion semantics. (2) Trajectory Wavelet Reconstruction uses learnable inverse wavelet transforms to reconstruct original joint trajectories from extracted features, ensuring the preservation of essential spatial-temporal information. (3) Disordered Motion Sequence Prediction reorders shuffled motion sequences to improve the learning of inherent temporal coherence, enhancing motion-text alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate WaMo's superiority, achieving 17.0\% and 18.2\% improvements in $Rsum$ on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets, respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> |  |

Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

In this work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second, reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in imitation learning.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in accelerating CoT reasoning.</p></details> |  |

So far, a substantial body of control research has focused on emulating snake locomotion and replicating its distinctive movement patterns using shape functions that either ignore the complexity of interactions or focus on complex interactions with matter (e.g., burrowing movements). However, models and control frameworks that lie in between these two paradigms and are based on simple, fundamental rigid body dynamics, which alleviate the challenging contact and control allocation problems in snake locomotion, remain absent. This work makes meaningful contributions, substantiated by simulations and experiments, in the following directions: 1) introducing a reduced-order model based on Moreau's stepping-forward approach from differential inclusion mathematics, 2) verifying model accuracy, 3) experimental validation.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes general-purpose pretrained neural networks to predict these metrics. The contributions of this paper are as follows: Firstly, based on the confirmation of the Scaling Law applicable to low-thrust trajectory approximation, the largest dataset is constructed using the proposed homotopy ray method, which aligns with mission-design-oriented data requirements. Secondly, the data are transformed into a self-similar space, enabling the neural network to adapt to arbitrary semi-major axes, inclinations, and central bodies. This extends the applicability beyond existing studies and can generalize across diverse mission scenarios without retraining. Thirdly, to the best of our knowledge, this work presents the current most general and accurate low-thrust trajectory approximator, with implementations available in C++, Python, and MATLAB. The resulting neural network achieves a relative error of 0.78% in predicting velocity increments and 0.63% in minimum transfer time estimation. The models have also been validated on a third-party dataset, multi-flyby mission design problem, and mission analysis scenario, demonstrating their generalization capability, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

This paper establishes a method that approaches global optimality for multi-flyby trajectory optimization under a given sequence. The original optimal control problem with interior-point equality constraints is transformed into a multi-stage decision formulation. This reformulation enables direct application of dynamic programming in lower dimensions, and follows Bellman's principle of optimality. Moreover, the method provides a quantifiable bound on global optima errors introduced by discretization and approximation assumptions, thus ensuring a measure of confidence in the obtained solution. The method accommodates both impulsive and low-thrust maneuver schemes in rendezvous and flyby scenarios. Several computational techniques are introduced to enhance efficiency, including a specialized solution for bi-impulse cases and an adaptive step refinement strategy. The proposed method is validated through three problems: 1) an impulsive variant of the fourth Global Trajectory Optimization competition problem (GTOC4), 2) the GTOC11 problem, and 3) the original low-thrust GTOC4 problem. Each case demonstrates improvements in fuel consumption over the best-known trajectories. These results give evidence of the generality and effectiveness of the proposed method in global trajectory optimization.</p></details> |  |

Many existing approaches assume access to other agents' episodic trajectories, a condition often unrealistic in real-world applications. Consequently, a practical agent modeling approach must learn a robust representation of the policies of the other agents based only on the local trajectory of the controlled agent. In this paper, we propose \texttt{TransAM}, a novel transformer-based agent modeling approach to encode local trajectories into an embedding space that effectively captures the policies of other agents. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in cooperative, competitive, and mixed multi-agent environments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach generates strong policy representations, improves agent modeling, and leads to higher episodic returns.</p></details> |  |
| **[User Trajectory Prediction Unifying Global and Local Temporal Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02161v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is essential for formulating proactive strategies that anticipate user mobility and support advance preparation. Therefore, how to reduce the forecasting error in user trajectory prediction within an acceptable inference time arises as an interesting issue. However, trajectory data contains both global and local temporal information, complicating the extraction of the complete temporal pattern. Moreover, user behavior occurs over different time scales, increasing the difficulty of capturing behavioral patterns. To address these challenges, a trajectory prediction model based on multilayer perceptron (MLP), multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN), and cross-attention (CA) is proposed. Specifically, MLP is used to extract the global temporal information of each feature. In parallel, MSCNN is employed to extract the local temporal information by modeling interactions among features within a local temporal range. Convolutional kernels with different sizes are used in MSCNN to capture temporal information at multiple resolutions, enhancing the model's adaptability to different behavioral patterns. Finally, CA is applied to fuse the global and local temporal information. Experimental results show that our model reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 5.04% and mean absolute error (MAE) by 4.35% compared with ModernTCN in 12-step prediction, while maintaining similar inference time.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the imbalance between self-consistency and cross-consistency, these CD-based methods inherently suffer from improper conditional guidance, leading to sub-optimal generation results. To address this issue, we present SegmentDreamer, a novel framework designed to fully unleash the potential of consistency models for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation. Specifically, we reformulate SDS through the proposed Segmented Consistency Trajectory Distillation (SCTD), effectively mitigating the imbalance issues by explicitly defining the relationship between self- and cross-consistency. Moreover, SCTD partitions the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories and ensures consistency within each segment, which can theoretically provide a significantly tighter upper bound on distillation error. Additionally, we propose a distillation pipeline for a more swift and stable generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SegmentDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, enabling high-fidelity 3D asset creation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025, project page: https://zjhjojo.github.io/segmentdreamer/</p></details> |

Starting from the observation that polychronous neural groups (PNGs) encode reproducible, time-locked spike sequences shaped by axonal delays and synaptic plasticity, we construct spatiotemporal complexes whose temporally consistent transitions define chain complexes over which robust activation cycles emerge. These activation loops are abstracted into cell posets, enabling a compact and causally ordered representation of neural activity with overlapping and compositional memory traces. We introduce the delta-homology analogy, which formalizes memory as a set of sparse, topologically irreducible attractors. A Dirac delta-like memory trace is identified with a nontrivial homology generator on a latent manifold of cognitive states. Such traces are sharply localized along reproducible topological cycles and are only activated when inference trajectories complete a full cycle. They encode minimal, path-dependent memory units that cannot be synthesized from local features alone. We interpret these delta-homology generators as the low-entropy content variable, while the high-entropy context variable is represented dually as a filtration, cohomology class, or sheaf over the same latent space. Inference is recast as a dynamic alignment between content and context and coherent memory retrieval corresponds to the existence of a global section that selects and sustains a topological generator. Memory is no longer a static attractor or distributed code, but a cycle-completing, structure-aware inference process.</p></details> |  |

Using common quantization method directly on node embeddings may overlooks their graph based structure, causing error accumulation during message passing and degrading the quality of quantized embeddings.To address this, we propose Graph based Node-Aware Dynamic Quantization training for collaborative filtering (GNAQ), a novel quantization approach that leverages graph structural information to enhance the balance between efficiency and accuracy of GNNs for Top-K recommendation. GNAQ introduces a node-aware dynamic quantization strategy that adapts quantization scales to individual node embeddings by incorporating graph interaction relationships. Specifically, it initializes quantization intervals based on node-wise feature distributions and dynamically refines them through message passing in GNN layers. This approach mitigates information loss caused by fixed quantization scales and captures hierarchical semantic features in user-item interaction graphs. Additionally, GNAQ employs graph relation-aware gradient estimation to replace traditional straight-through estimators, ensuring more accurate gradient propagation during training. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that GNAQ outperforms state-of-the-art quantization methods, including BiGeaR and N2UQ, by achieving average improvement in 27.8\% Recall@10 and 17.6\% NDCG@10 under 2-bit quantization. In particular, GNAQ is capable of maintaining the performance of full-precision models while reducing their model sizes by 8 to 12 times; in addition, the training time is twice as fast compared to quantization baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often fail to fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version of the paper accepted to IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI'25), 2025.

Existing machine learning (ML) surrogates often require large datasets to generalize across various topologies or to accurately model skewed and multi-modal performance metrics. In this work, a lightweight, data-efficient, and topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) model is proposed for predicting key performance metrics of multiple topologies of active RF circuits such as low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), and PAs. To capture transistor-level symmetry and preserve fine-grained connectivity details, circuits are modeled at the device-terminal level, enabling scalable message passing while reducing data requirements. Masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads are incorporated to improve robustness in modeling complex target distributions. Experiments on datasets demonstrate high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%, respectively. Owing to the pin-level conversion of circuit to graph and ML architecture robust to modeling complex densities of RF metrics, the MRE is improved by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior work, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for rapid and accurate RF circuit design automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

FGL does that by leveraging the passive movement of energy-constrained nanodevices circulating through the bloodstream. Existing FGL solutions rely on graph models with fixed topologies or handcrafted features, which limit their adaptability to anatomical variability and hinder scalability. In this work, we explore the use of Set Transformer architectures to address these limitations. Our formulation treats nanodevices' circulation time reports as unordered sets, enabling permutation-invariant, variable-length input processing without relying on spatial priors. To improve robustness under data scarcity and class imbalance, we integrate synthetic data generation via deep generative models, including CGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, and CVAE. These models are trained to replicate realistic circulation time distributions conditioned on vascular region labels, and are used to augment the training data. Our results show that the Set Transformer achieves comparable classification accuracy compared to Graph Neural Networks (GNN) baselines, while simultaneously providing by-design improved generalization to anatomical variability. The findings highlight the potential of permutation-invariant models and synthetic augmentation for robust and scalable nanoscale localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables, 26 references, accepted at ACM NanoCom'25</p></details> |

To handle the challenges arising from dynamic low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite topologies and heterogeneous content demands, we propose a learning-based framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The satellite network is represented as a dynamic graph, where GNNs are embedded within the DRL agent to capture spatial and topological dependencies and support routing-aware decision-making. The caching strategy is optimized by formulating the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and applying soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the delivery success rate and reduces communication traffic cost.</p></details> | 5 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Robust Graph Contrastive Learning with Information Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12555v3)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The graph contrastive learning (GCL) framework has gained remarkable achievements in graph representation learning. However, similar to graph neural networks (GNNs), GCL models are susceptible to graph structural attacks. As an unsupervised method, GCL faces greater challenges in defending against adversarial attacks. Furthermore, there has been limited research on enhancing the robustness of GCL. To thoroughly explore the failure of GCL on the poisoned graphs, we investigate the detrimental effects of graph structural attacks against the GCL framework. We discover that, in addition to the conventional observation that graph structural attacks tend to connect dissimilar node pairs, these attacks also diminish the mutual information between the graph and its representations from an information-theoretical perspective, which is the cornerstone of the high-quality node embeddings for GCL. Motivated by this theoretical insight, we propose a robust graph contrastive learning framework with a learnable sanitation view that endeavors to sanitize the augmented graphs by restoring the diminished mutual information caused by the structural attacks. Additionally, we design a fully unsupervised tuning strategy to tune the hyperparameters without accessing the label information, which strictly coincides with the defender's knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method compared to competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |

While first principles calculations are accurate in predicting these properties, their computational expense combined with the vast search space of surfaces make a comprehensive screening approach with density functional theory (DFT) infeasible. Here, we introduce FIRE-GNN (Force-Informed, Relaxed Equivariance Graph Neural Network), which integrates surface-normal symmetry breaking and machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP)-derived force information, achieving a twofold reduction in mean absolute error (down to 0.065 eV) over the previous state-of-the-art for work function prediction. We additionally benchmark recent invariant and equivariant architectures, analyze the impact of symmetry breaking, and evaluate out-of-distribution generalization, demonstrating that FIRE-GNN consistently outperforms competing models for work function predictions. This model enables accurate and rapid predictions of the work function and cleavage energy across a vast chemical space and facilitates the discovery of materials with tuned surface properties</p></details> |  |

However, various PIM devices such as ReRAM, FeFET, PCM, MRAM, and SRAM exist, with each device offering unique trade-offs in terms of power, latency, area, and non-idealities. A heterogeneous manycore architecture enabled by 3D integration can combine multiple PIM devices on a single platform, to enable energy-efficient and high-performance GNN training. In this work, we propose a 3D heterogeneous PIM-based accelerator for GNN training referred to as HePGA. We leverage the unique characteristics of GNN layers and associated computing kernels to optimize their mapping on to different PIM devices as well as planar tiers. Our experimental analysis shows that HePGA outperforms existing PIM-based architectures by up to 3.8x and 6.8x in energy-efficiency (TOPS/W) and compute efficiency (TOPS/mm2) respectively, without sacrificing the GNN prediction accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of HePGA to accelerate inferencing of emerging transformer models.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes the Tree-like Pairwise Interaction Network (PIN), a novel neural network architecture that explicitly captures pairwise feature interactions through a shared feed-forward neural network architecture that mimics the structure of decision trees. PIN enables intrinsic interpretability by design, allowing for direct inspection of interaction effects. Moreover, it allows for efficient SHapley's Additive exPlanation (SHAP) computations because it only involves pairwise interactions. We highlight connections between PIN and established models such as GA2Ms, gradient boosting machines, and graph neural networks. Empirical results on the popular French motor insurance dataset show that PIN outperforms both traditional and modern neural networks benchmarks in predictive accuracy, while also providing insight into how features interact with each another and how they contribute to the predictions.</p></details> |  |

With the growing adoption of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), CFG-based representations have proven highly effective for malware detection. This study proposes a novel framework that dynamically constructs CFGs and embeds node features using a hybrid approach combining rule-based encoding and autoencoder-based embedding. A GNN-based classifier is then constructed to detect malicious behavior from the resulting graph representations. To improve model interpretability, we apply state-of-the-art explainability techniques, including GNNExplainer, PGExplainer, and CaptumExplainer, the latter is utilized three attribution methods: Integrated Gradients, Guided Backpropagation, and Saliency. In addition, we introduce a novel aggregation method, called RankFusion, that integrates the outputs of the top-performing explainers to enhance the explanation quality. We also evaluate explanations using two subgraph extraction strategies, including the proposed Greedy Edge-wise Composition (GEC) method for improved structural coherence. A comprehensive evaluation using accuracy, fidelity, and consistency metrics demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of accurate identification of malware samples and generating reliable and interpretable explanations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Let's Grow an Unbiased Community: Guiding the Fairness of Graphs via New Links](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15499v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[JEDI-linear: Fast and Efficient Graph Neural Networks for Jet Tagging on FPGAs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15468v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Interaction Networks (INs), have shown exceptional performance for jet tagging at the CERN High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). However, their computational complexity and irregular memory access patterns pose significant challenges for deployment on FPGAs in hardware trigger systems, where strict latency and resource constraints apply. In this work, we propose JEDI-linear, a novel GNN architecture with linear computational complexity that eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by leveraging shared transformations and global aggregation. To further enhance hardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with per-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free multiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results show that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency, up to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage compared to state-of-the-art designs while also delivering higher model accuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. In contrast, state-of-the-art solutions consume over 8,700 DSPs. This is the first interaction-based GNN to achieve less than 60~ns latency and currently meets the requirements for use in the HL-LHC CMS Level-1 trigger system. This work advances the next-generation trigger systems by enabling accurate, scalable, and resource-efficient GNN inference in real-time environments. Our open-sourced templates will further support reproducibility and broader adoption across scientific applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and tested on different datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability, which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL (Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more transparent and actionable molecular modeling.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification.

However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs can exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender. Moreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and message-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias by filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge dropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may unintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised balance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias mitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using counterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node representations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial discriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN classifiers. Our proposed technique, Fair-ICD, ensures the fairness of GNNs under moderate conditions. Experiments on standard datasets using three GNN backbones demonstrate that Fair-ICD notably enhances fairness metrics while preserving high predictive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 2024 KDD Workshop</p></details> |

The key challenge in graph density estimation lies in effectively capturing both structural patterns and semantic variations while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Combining graph kernels and kernel density estimation (KDE) is a standard approach to graph density estimation, but has unsatisfactory performance due to the handcrafted and fixed features of kernels. Our method LGKDE leverages graph neural networks to represent each graph as a discrete distribution and utilizes maximum mean discrepancy to learn the graph metric for multi-scale KDE, where all parameters are learned by maximizing the density of graphs relative to the density of their well-designed perturbed counterparts. The perturbations are conducted on both node features and graph spectra, which helps better characterize the boundary of normal density regions. Theoretically, we establish consistency and convergence guarantees for LGKDE, including bounds on the mean integrated squared error, robustness, and complexity. We validate LGKDE by demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering the underlying density of synthetic graph distributions and applying it to graph anomaly detection across diverse benchmark datasets. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that LGKDE demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on most benchmark datasets.</p></details> | Under Review |

These models feature uniqueness in efficient computation as well as rich expressiveness, which stems from advanced management and profound understanding of graph data. However, few systematic studies have been conducted to assess spectral GNNs, particularly in benchmarking their efficiency, memory consumption, and effectiveness in a unified and fair manner. There is also a pressing need to select spectral models suitable for learning specific graph data and deploying them to massive web-scale graphs, which is currently constrained by the varied model designs and training settings. In this work, we extensively benchmark spectral GNNs with a focus on the spectral perspective, demystifying them as spectral graph filters. We analyze and categorize 35 GNNs with 27 corresponding filters, spanning diverse formulations and utilizations of the graph data. Then, we implement the filters within a unified spectral-oriented framework with dedicated graph computations and efficient training schemes. In particular, our implementation enables the deployment of spectral GNNs over million-scale graphs and various tasks with comparable performance and less overhead. Thorough experiments are conducted on the graph filters with comprehensive metrics on effectiveness and efficiency, offering novel observations and practical guidelines that are only available from our evaluations across graph scales. Different from the prevailing belief, our benchmark reveals an intricate landscape regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of spectral graph filters, demonstrating the potential to achieve desirable performance through tailored spectral manipulation of graph data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report with Appendix.

To improve classification accuracy and stability, the framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer. The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1 metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability, providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive diseases such as Parkinson's disease.</p></details> |  |

It proposes a fine-tuning algorithm framework based on knowledge graph injection. The method builds on pretrained language models and introduces structured graph information for auxiliary learning. A graph neural network is used to encode entities and their relations, constructing a graph-based semantic representation. A fusion mechanism is then designed to jointly model the knowledge graph embeddings with the contextual representations from the language model. To enhance the robustness of knowledge integration, a gating mechanism is introduced to dynamically balance the contributions of linguistic semantics and structural knowledge. This effectively mitigates conflicts between different representational spaces. During training, a joint loss function is constructed to account for both task performance and structural alignment objectives. This helps improve the accuracy of entity prediction and semantic reasoning. The study also includes a series of systematic sensitivity experiments. It evaluates the effects of learning rate, graph coverage, and structural perturbations on model performance. The results further validate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed method across tasks such as entity recognition, question answering, and language generation. Experimental findings show that the proposed structure-aware fine-tuning framework significantly enhances the model's ability to represent complex semantic units. It demonstrates better semantic consistency and contextual logic modeling in scenarios involving structural reasoning and entity extraction.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Interplay between Graph Structure and Learning Algorithms in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14338v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the interplay between learning algorithms and graph structure for graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing theoretical studies on the learning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning algorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude connection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum degree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk (generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the generalization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional settings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine how graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several key contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure and learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and Ridge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure through spectral graph theory. With this established framework, we further explore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the performance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we extend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing non-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights into the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning algorithms. Our empirical results align with our theoretical predictions, \emph{collectively showcasing a coupling relation among graph structure, GNNs and learning algorithms, and providing insights on GNN algorithm design and selection in practice.}</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14330v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition (GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gctd-345A.</p></details> |  |

This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP), a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers. We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature, our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with lower computational cost (without ensemble). While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods.

| **[Scaling Up without Fading Out: Goal-Aware Sparse GNN for RL-based Generalized Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10747v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow, especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale generalized planning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Refining Contrastive Learning and Homography Relations for Multi-Modal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13745v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal recommender system focuses on utilizing rich modal information ( i.e., images and textual descriptions) of items to improve recommendation performance. The current methods have achieved remarkable success with the powerful structure modeling capability of graph neural networks. However, these methods are often hindered by sparse data in real-world scenarios. Although contrastive learning and homography ( i.e., homogeneous graphs) are employed to address the data sparsity challenge, existing methods still suffer two main limitations: 1) Simple multi-modal feature contrasts fail to produce effective representations, causing noisy modal-shared features and loss of valuable information in modal-unique features; 2) The lack of exploration of the homograph relations between user interests and item co-occurrence results in incomplete mining of user-item interplay. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for \textbf{R}\textbf{E}fining multi-mod\textbf{A}l cont\textbf{R}astive learning and ho\textbf{M}ography relations (\textbf{REARM}). Specifically, we complement multi-modal contrastive learning by employing meta-network and orthogonal constraint strategies, which filter out noise in modal-shared features and retain recommendation-relevant information in modal-unique features. To mine homogeneous relationships effectively, we integrate a newly constructed user interest graph and an item co-occurrence graph with the existing user co-occurrence and item semantic graphs for graph learning. The extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of REARM to various state-of-the-art baselines. Our visualization further shows an improvement made by REARM in distinguishing between modal-shared and modal-unique features.

However, the scalability of full-batch GNN training becomes severely limited by high communication overhead and load imbalance in distributed environments. In this paper, we present CaPGNN, a novel framework for efficient parallel full-batch GNN training on single-server with multi-GPU, designed specifically to reduce redundant inter-GPU communication and balance computational workloads. We propose a joint adaptive caching algorithm that leverages both CPU and GPU memory to significantly reduce the repetitive transmission of vertex features across partitions. Additionally, we introduce a resource-aware graph partitioning algorithm that adjusts subgraph sizes dynamically according to the heterogeneous computational and communication capacities of GPUs. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that CaPGNN effectively reduces communication costs by up to 96% and accelerates GNN training by up to 12.7 times compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our results highlight the potential of adaptive caching and resource-aware partitioning to facilitate scalable, efficient, and practical deployment of full-batch GNN training in distributed computing environments.</p></details> |  |

However, existing directed graph neural networks often struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.</p></details> |  |

Current state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains, producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships, multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical real-world applications.</p></details> | Submitted to IAAI-26 |

Given a hierarchical representation of the environment, the objective is to navigate from a start position to a goal, while satisfying task-specific safety constraints and minimizing computational cost. We introduce Hierarchical Class-ordered A* (HCOA*), an algorithm that leverages the environment's hierarchy for efficient and safe path-planning in mixed geometric/semantic graphs. We use a total order over the semantic classes and prove theoretical performance guarantees for the algorithm. We propose three approaches for higher-layer node classification based on the semantics of the lowest layer: a Graph Neural Network method, a k-Nearest Neighbors method, and a Majority-Class method. We evaluate HCOA* in simulations on two 3D Scene Graphs, comparing it to the state-of-the-art and assessing the performance of each classification approach. Results show that HCOA* reduces the computational time of navigation by up to 50%, while maintaining near-optimal performance across a wide range of scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[GraphLand: Evaluating Graph Machine Learning Models on Diverse Industrial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14500v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although data that can be naturally represented as graphs is widespread in real-world applications across diverse industries, popular graph ML benchmarks for node property prediction only cover a surprisingly narrow set of data domains, and graph neural networks (GNNs) are often evaluated on just a few academic citation networks. This issue is particularly pressing in light of the recent growing interest in designing graph foundation models. These models are supposed to be able to transfer to diverse graph datasets from different domains, and yet the proposed graph foundation models are often evaluated on a very limited set of datasets from narrow applications. To alleviate this issue, we introduce GraphLand: a benchmark of 14 diverse graph datasets for node property prediction from a range of different industrial applications. GraphLand allows evaluating graph ML models on a wide range of graphs with diverse sizes, structural characteristics, and feature sets, all in a unified setting. Further, GraphLand allows investigating such previously underexplored research questions as how realistic temporal distributional shifts under transductive and inductive settings influence graph ML model performance. To mimic realistic industrial settings, we use GraphLand to compare GNNs with gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) models that are popular in industrial applications and show that GBDTs provided with additional graph-based input features can sometimes be very strong baselines. Further, we evaluate currently available general-purpose graph foundation models and find that they fail to produce competitive results on our proposed datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoTO: Robust Topology Obfuscation Against Tomography Inference Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12852v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tomography inference attacks aim to reconstruct network topology by analyzing end-to-end probe delays. Existing defenses mitigate these attacks by manipulating probe delays to mislead inference, but rely on two strong assumptions: (i) probe packets can be perfectly detected and altered, and (ii) attackers use known, fixed inference algorithms. These assumptions often break in practice, leading to degraded defense performance under detection errors or adaptive adversaries. We present RoTO, a robust topology obfuscation scheme that eliminates both assumptions by modeling uncertainty in attacker-observed delays through a distributional formulation. RoTO casts the defense objective as a min-max optimization problem that maximizes expected topological distortion across this uncertainty set, without relying on perfect probe control or specific attacker models. To approximate attacker behavior, RoTO leverages graph neural networks for inference simulation and adversarial training. We also derive an upper bound on attacker success probability, and demonstrate that our approach enhances topology obfuscation performance through the optimization of this upper bound. Experimental results show that RoTO outperforms existing defense methods, achieving average improvements of 34% in structural similarity and 42.6% in link distance while maintaining strong robustness and concealment capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Multi-Agent Epistemic Planning through GNN-Derived Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12840v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) is an autonomous planning framework for reasoning about both the physical world and the beliefs of agents, with applications in domains where information flow and awareness among agents are critical. The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance, resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate them against standard baselines, showing significant improvements in the scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Modeling of Full-Atom Protein Conformations using Latent Diffusion on Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17064v4)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of dynamic proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for understanding their function, yet most generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore conformational diversity altogether. We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (main text), 4 figures, 2 tables.

| **[S2FGL: Spatial Spectral Federated Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02409v4)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL from the structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label signals and a degradation in the semantic knowledge of the global GNN. From a spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drift occurs, undermining global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global knowledge repository to mitigate the challenge of poor semantic knowledge caused by label signal disruption. Furthermore, we design a frequency alignment to address spectral client drift. The combination of Spatial and Spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[MPOCryptoML: Multi-Pattern based Off-Chain Crypto Money Laundering Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12641v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in money laundering detection have demonstrated the potential of using graph neural networks to capture laundering patterns accurately. However, existing models are not explicitly designed to detect the diverse patterns of off-chain cryptocurrency money laundering. Neglecting any laundering pattern introduces critical detection gaps, as each pattern reflects unique transactional structures that facilitate the obfuscation of illicit fund origins and movements. Failure to account for these patterns may result in under-detection or omission of specific laundering activities, diminishing model accuracy and allowing schemes to bypass detection. To address this gap, we propose the MPOCryptoML model to effectively detect multiple laundering patterns in cryptocurrency transactions. MPOCryptoML includes the development of a multi-source Personalized PageRank algorithm to identify random laundering patterns. Additionally, we introduce two novel algorithms by analyzing the timestamp and weight of transactions in high-volume financial networks to detect various money laundering structures, including fan-in, fan-out, bipartite, gather-scatter, and stack patterns. We further examine correlations between these patterns using a logistic regression model. An anomaly score function integrates results from each module to rank accounts by anomaly score, systematically identifying high-risk accounts. Extensive experiments on public datasets including Elliptic++, Ethereum fraud detection, and Wormhole transaction datasets validate the efficacy and efficiency of MPOCryptoML. Results show consistent performance gains, with improvements up to 9.13% in precision, up to 10.16% in recall, up to 7.63% in F1-score, and up to 10.19% in accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Toward this goal, significant effort has focused on developing models that jointly sample molecular topology and 3D structure. We present FlowMol3, an open-source, multi-modal flow matching model that advances the state of the art for all-atom, small-molecule generation. Its substantial performance gains over previous FlowMol versions are achieved without changes to the graph neural network architecture or the underlying flow matching formulation. Instead, FlowMol3's improvements arise from three architecture-agnostic techniques that incur negligible computational cost: self-conditioning, fake atoms, and train-time geometry distortion. FlowMol3 achieves nearly 100% molecular validity for drug-like molecules with explicit hydrogens, more accurately reproduces the functional group composition and geometry of its training data, and does so with an order of magnitude fewer learnable parameters than comparable methods. We hypothesize that these techniques mitigate a general pathology affecting transport-based generative models, enabling detection and correction of distribution drift during inference. Our results highlight simple, transferable strategies for improving the stability and quality of diffusion- and flow-based molecular generative models.</p></details> |  |

Central to this effort is the development of invariant and equivariant operations. This works presents a systematic method for constructing valid invariant and equivariant operations. It can handle inputs and outputs in the form of Cartesian tensors with different rank, as well as spherical tensors with different types. In addition, our method features a graphical representation utilizing the symmetric tensor network, which simplifies both the proofs and constructions related to invariant and equivariant functions. We also apply this approach to design the equivariant interaction message for the geometry graph neural network, and equivariant machine learning model to learn the constitutive law of materials.</p></details> |  |

While prior methods rely on invasive signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) for high predictive accuracy, these approaches require specialized hardware and are impractical for real-world applications. In this work, we propose a scalable, deployable framework for personalized cybersickness prediction leveraging only non-invasive signals readily available from commercial VR headsets, including head motion, eye tracking, and physiological responses. Our model employs a modality-specific graph neural network enhanced with a Difference Attention Module to extract temporal-spatial embeddings capturing dynamic changes across modalities. A cross-modal alignment module jointly trains the video encoder to learn personalized traits by aligning video features with sensor-derived representations. Consequently, the model accurately predicts individual cybersickness using only video input during inference. Experimental results show our model achieves 88.4\% accuracy, closely matching EEG-based approaches (89.16\%), while reducing deployment complexity. With an average inference latency of 90ms, our framework supports real-time applications, ideal for integration into consumer-grade VR platforms without compromising personalization or performance.

| **[SGPT: Few-Shot Prompt Tuning for Signed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12155v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are effective in learning expressive representations for signed graphs but typically require substantial task-specific labels, limiting their applicability in label-scarce industrial scenarios. In contrast, unsigned graph structures are abundant and can be readily leveraged to pre-train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offering a promising solution to reduce supervision requirements in downstream signed graph tasks. However, transferring knowledge from unsigned to signed graphs is non-trivial due to the fundamental discrepancies in graph types and task objectives between pre-training and downstream phases. To address this challenge, we propose Signed Graph Prompt Tuning (SGPT), a novel graph prompting framework that adapts pre-trained unsigned GNNs to few-shot signed graph tasks. We first design a graph template based on balance theory to disentangle mixed node relationships introduced by negative links, mitigating the structural mismatches between unsigned and signed graphs. We further introduce a task template that reformulates downstream signed tasks into a unified link prediction objective, aligning their optimization goals with the pre-training task. Furthermore, we develop feature prompts that align downstream semantic spaces with the feature spaces learned during pre-training, and semantic prompts to integrate link sign semantics in a task-aware manner. We conduct extensive experiments on seven benchmark signed graph datasets, demonstrating that SGPT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, establishing a powerful and generalizable solution for few-shot signed graph learning.</p></details> | CIKM'25 |
| **[CRoC: Context Refactoring Contrast for Graph Anomaly Detection with Limited Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12278v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used as the engine for various graph-related tasks, with their effectiveness in analyzing graph-structured data. However, training robust GNNs often demands abundant labeled data, which is a critical bottleneck in real-world applications. This limitation severely impedes progress in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD), where anomalies are inherently rare, costly to label, and may actively camouflage their patterns to evade detection. To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring Contrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by jointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from previous works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor the context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the attributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore, CRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the message-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex interaction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while encouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover intricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated with the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness unlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative node embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRoC achieves up to 14% AUC improvement over baseline GNNs and outperforms state-of-the-art GAD methods under limited-label settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECAI 2025</p></details> |

While adhering to an assigned travel budget the algorithm seeks to maximize collected reward while incurring stochastic travel costs. In this context, the acceptable probability of exceeding the assigned budget is expressed as a chance constraint. Our MCTS solution is an online and anytime algorithm alternating planning and execution that determines the next vertex to visit by continuously monitoring the remaining travel budget. The novelty of our work is that the rollout phase in the MCTS framework is implemented using a message passing GNN, predicting both the utility and failure probability of each available action. This allows to enormously expedite the search process. Our experimental evaluation shows that with the proposed method and architecture we manage to efficiently solve complex problem instances while incurring in moderate losses in terms of collected reward. Moreover, we demonstrate how the approach is capable of generalizing beyond the characteristics of the training dataset.

| **[Implicit Hypergraph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14101v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for capturing high-order relationships between entities and have been widely applied in various domains, including healthcare, social networks, and bioinformatics. Hypergraph neural networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks. Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance. Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICDM 2025</p></details> |

However, current reasoning models often lack explicit semantic hierarchies, user-domain knowledge alignment, and principled mechanisms to prune reasoning threads for effectiveness. These limitations result in lengthy generic output that does not guide users through goal-oriented reasoning steps. To address this, we propose a prototype-inspired, two-phases Reasoning-Threads-Evaluation (ReT-Eval) framework, drawing inspiration from human-like reasoning strategies that emphasize structured knowledge reuse. In the first phase, semantically relevant knowledge structures are extracted from a sparse domain knowledge graph using a graph neural network and enriched with intrinsic large language model knowledge to resolve knowledge discrepancies. In the second phase, these threads are evaluated and pruned using a reward-guided strategy aimed at maintaining semantic coherence to generate effective reasoning threads. Experiments and expert evaluations show that ReT-Eval enhances user understanding and outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 1 figure, 6 tables</p></details> |

We model the occurrence of supply edges (firm i to firm j) as a non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP), using historical event counts to estimate the Poisson intensity function up to time t. However, forecasting future intensities is hindered by the limitations of historical data alone. To overcome this, we propose a novel Graph Double Exponential Smoothing (GDES) model, which integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with a nonparametric double exponential smoothing approach to predict the probability of future supply edge formations.Recognizing the interdependent economic dynamics between upstream and downstream firms, we assume that the Poisson intensity functions of supply edges are correlated, aligning with the non-homogeneous nature of the process.Our model is interpretable, decomposing intensity increments into contributions from the current edge's historical data and influences from neighboring edges in the supply chain network. Evaluated on a large-scale supply chain dataset with 87,969 firms, our approach achieves an AUC of 93.84 % in dynamic link prediction, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex supply chain interactions for accurate forecasting.</p></details> | 17 pages, 2 figures |
| **[OneForecast: A Universal Framework for Global and Regional Weather Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00338v3)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate weather forecasts are important for disaster prevention, agricultural planning, etc. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods offer physically interpretable high-accuracy predictions but are computationally expensive and fail to fully leverage rapidly growing historical data. In recent years, deep learning models have made significant progress in weather forecasting, but challenges remain, such as balancing global and regional high-resolution forecasts, excessive smoothing in extreme event predictions, and insufficient dynamic system modeling. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global-regional nested weather forecasting framework (OneForecast) based on graph neural networks. By combining a dynamic system perspective with multi-grid theory, we construct a multi-scale graph structure and densify the target region to capture local high-frequency features. We introduce an adaptive messaging mechanism, using dynamic gating units to deeply integrate node and edge features for more accurate extreme event forecasting. For high-resolution regional forecasts, we propose a neural nested grid method to mitigate boundary information loss. Experimental results show that OneForecast performs excellently across global to regional scales and short-term to long-term forecasts, especially in extreme event predictions.

Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds promise for developing objective, scalable, and timely diagnostic tools. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art AI methods for depression detection and diagnosis, based on a systematic review of 55 key studies. We introduce a novel hierarchical taxonomy that structures the field by primary clinical task (diagnosis vs. prediction), data modality (text, speech, neuroimaging, multimodal), and computational model class (e.g., graph neural networks, large language models, hybrid approaches). Our in-depth analysis reveals three major trends: the predominance of graph neural networks for modeling brain connectivity, the rise of large language models for linguistic and conversational data, and an emerging focus on multimodal fusion, explainability, and algorithmic fairness. Alongside methodological insights, we provide an overview of prominent public datasets and standard evaluation metrics as a practical guide for researchers. By synthesizing current advances and highlighting open challenges, this survey offers a comprehensive roadmap for future innovation in computational psychiatry.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRIDE: Structure and Embedding Distillation with Attention for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15938v2)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have led to increased model sizes to enhance their capacity and accuracy. Such large models incur high memory usage, latency, and computational costs, thereby restricting their inference deployment. GNN compression techniques compress large GNNs into smaller ones with negligible accuracy loss. One of the most promising compression techniques is knowledge distillation (KD). However, most KD approaches for GNNs only consider the outputs of the last layers and do not consider the outputs of the intermediate layers of the GNNs. The intermediate layers may contain important inductive biases indicated by the graph structure and embeddings. Ignoring these layers may lead to a high accuracy drop, especially when the compression ratio is high. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel KD approach for GNN compression that we call Structure and Embedding Distillation with Attention (STRIDE). STRIDE utilizes attention to identify important intermediate teacher-student layer pairs and focuses on using those pairs to align graph structure and node embeddings. We evaluate STRIDE on several datasets, such as OGBN-Mag and OGBN-Arxiv, using different model architectures, including GCNIIs, RGCNs, and GraphSAGE. On average, STRIDE achieves a 2.13% increase in accuracy with a 32.3X compression ratio on OGBN-Mag, a large graph dataset, compared to state-of-the-art approaches. On smaller datasets (e.g., Pubmed), STRIDE achieves up to a 141X compression ratio with the same accuracy as state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of focusing on intermediate-layer knowledge to obtain compact, accurate, and practical GNN models.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Pixels to Graphs: Deep Graph-Level Anomaly Detection on Dermoscopic Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11826v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful approach for graph-based machine learning tasks. Previous work applied GNNs to image-derived graph representations for various downstream tasks such as classification or anomaly detection. These transformations include segmenting images, extracting features from segments, mapping them to nodes, and connecting them. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has rigorously compared the effectiveness of the numerous potential image-to-graph transformation approaches for GNN-based graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD). In this study, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of multiple segmentation schemes, edge construction strategies, and node feature sets based on color, texture, and shape descriptors to produce suitable image-derived graph representations to perform graph-level anomaly detection. We conduct extensive experiments on dermoscopic images using state-of-the-art GLAD models, examining performance and efficiency in purely unsupervised, weakly supervised, and fully supervised regimes. Our findings reveal, for example, that color descriptors contribute the best standalone performance, while incorporating shape and texture features consistently enhances detection efficacy. In particular, our best unsupervised configuration using OCGTL achieves a competitive AUC-ROC score of up to 0.805 without relying on pretrained backbones like comparable image-based approaches. With the inclusion of sparse labels, the performance increases substantially to 0.872 and with full supervision to 0.914 AUC-ROC.</p></details> |  |

With upgrades scheduled for the detectors of colliding-beam experiments around the world, and specifically at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, more collisions and more complex interactions are expected. This directly implies an increase in data produced and consequently in the computational resources needed to process them. At CERN, the amount of data produced is gargantuan. This is why the data have to be heavily filtered and selected in real time before being permanently stored. This data can then be used to perform physics analyses, in order to expand our current understanding of the universe and improve the Standard Model of physics. This real-time filtering, known as triggering, involves complex processing happening often at frequencies as high as 40 MHz. This thesis contributes to understanding how machine learning models can be efficiently deployed in such environments, in order to maximize throughput and minimize energy consumption. Inevitably, modern hardware designed for such tasks and contemporary algorithms are needed in order to meet the challenges posed by the stringent, high-frequency data rates. In this work, I present our graph neural network-based pipeline, developed for charged particle track reconstruction at the LHCb experiment at CERN. The pipeline was implemented end-to-end inside LHCb's first-level trigger, entirely on GPUs. Its performance was compared against the classical tracking algorithms currently in production at LHCb. The pipeline was also accelerated on the FPGA architecture, and its performance in terms of power consumption and processing speed was compared against the GPU implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD t...</summary><p>PhD thesis, Chapters 8 and 9 include results from work performed in collaboration with Anthony Correia</p></details> |
| **[Towards Faithful Class-level Self-explainability in Graph Neural Networks by Subgraph Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11513v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the interpretability of graph neural networks (GNNs) is crucial to ensure their safe and fair deployment. Recent work has introduced self-explainable GNNs that generate explanations as part of training, improving both faithfulness and efficiency. Some of these models, such as ProtGNN and PGIB, learn class-specific prototypes, offering a potential pathway toward class-level explanations. However, their evaluations focus solely on instance-level explanations, leaving open the question of whether these prototypes meaningfully generalize across instances of the same class. In this paper, we introduce GraphOracle, a novel self-explainable GNN framework designed to generate and evaluate class-level explanations for GNNs. Our model jointly learns a GNN classifier and a set of structured, sparse subgraphs that are discriminative for each class. We propose a novel integrated training that captures graph$\unicode{x2013}$subgraph$\unicode{x2013}$prediction dependencies efficiently and faithfully, validated through a masking-based evaluation strategy. This strategy enables us to retroactively assess whether prior methods like ProtGNN and PGIB deliver effective class-level explanations. Our results show that they do not. In contrast, GraphOracle achieves superior fidelity, explainability, and scalability across a range of graph classification tasks. We further demonstrate that GraphOracle avoids the computational bottlenecks of previous methods$\unicode{x2014}$like Monte Carlo Tree Search$\unicode{x2014}$by using entropy-regularized subgraph selection and lightweight random walk extraction, enabling faster and more scalable training. These findings position GraphOracle as a practical and principled solution for faithful class-level self-explainability in GNNs.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Discovering Invariant Neighborhood Patterns for Heterophilic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10572v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the problem of distribution shifts on non-homophilous graphs Mosting existing graph neural network methods rely on the homophilous assumption that nodes from the same class are more likely to be linked. However, such assumptions of homophily do not always hold in real-world graphs, which leads to more complex distribution shifts unaccounted for in previous methods. The distribution shifts of neighborhood patterns are much more diverse on non-homophilous graphs. We propose a novel Invariant Neighborhood Pattern Learning (INPL) to alleviate the distribution shifts problem on non-homophilous graphs. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive Neighborhood Propagation (ANP) module to capture the adaptive neighborhood information, which could alleviate the neighborhood pattern distribution shifts problem on non-homophilous graphs. We propose Invariant Non-Homophilous Graph Learning (INHGL) module to constrain the ANP and learn invariant graph representation on non-homophilous graphs. Extensive experimental results on real-world non-homophilous graphs show that INPL could achieve state-of-the-art performance for learning on large non-homophilous graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Sensory Cognitive Computing for Learning Population-level Brain Connectivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11436v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of connectional brain templates (CBTs) has recently garnered significant attention for its potential to identify unique connectivity patterns shared across individuals. However, existing methods for CBT learning such as conventional machine learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) are hindered by several limitations. These include: (i) poor interpretability due to their black-box nature, (ii) high computational cost, and (iii) an exclusive focus on structure and topology, overlooking the cognitive capacity of the generated CBT. To address these challenges, we introduce mCOCO (multi-sensory COgnitive COmputing), a novel framework that leverages Reservoir Computing (RC) to learn population-level functional CBT from BOLD (Blood-Oxygen-level-Dependent) signals. RC's dynamic system properties allow for tracking state changes over time, enhancing interpretability and enabling the modeling of brain-like dynamics, as demonstrated in prior literature. By integrating multi-sensory inputs (e.g., text, audio, and visual data), mCOCO captures not only structure and topology but also how brain regions process information and adapt to cognitive tasks such as sensory processing, all in a computationally efficient manner. Our mCOCO framework consists of two phases: (1) mapping BOLD signals into the reservoir to derive individual functional connectomes, which are then aggregated into a group-level CBT - an approach, to the best of our knowledge, not previously explored in functional connectivity studies - and (2) incorporating multi-sensory inputs through a cognitive reservoir, endowing the CBT with cognitive traits. Extensive evaluations show that our mCOCO-based template significantly outperforms GNN-based CBT in terms of centeredness, discriminativeness, topological soundness, and multi-sensory memory retention. Our source code is available at https://github.com/basiralab/mCOCO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-Dissipative Graph Propagation for Non-Local Community Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14097v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Community detection in graphs aims to cluster nodes into meaningful groups, a task particularly challenging in heterophilic graphs, where nodes sharing similarities and membership to the same community are typically distantly connected. This is particularly evident when this task is tackled by graph neural networks, since they rely on an inherently local message passing scheme to learn the node representations that serve to cluster nodes into communities. In this work, we argue that the ability to propagate long-range information during message passing is key to effectively perform community detection in heterophilic graphs. To this end, we introduce the Unsupervised Antisymmetric Graph Neural Network (uAGNN), a novel unsupervised community detection approach leveraging non-dissipative dynamical systems to ensure stability and to propagate long-range information effectively. By employing antisymmetric weight matrices, uAGNN captures both local and global graph structures, overcoming the limitations posed by heterophilic scenarios. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate uAGNN's superior performance in high and medium heterophilic settings, where traditional methods fail to exploit long-range dependencies. These results highlight uAGNN's potential as a powerful tool for unsupervised community detection in diverse graph environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

However, many real-world systems, such as social or biological networks, exhibit complex interactions that are more naturally represented by higher-order topological domains. The emerging field of Geometric and Topological Deep Learning addresses this challenge by introducing methods that utilize and benefit from higher-order structures. Central to TDL is the concept of lifting, which transforms data representations from basic graph forms to more expressive topologies before the application of GNN models for learning. In this work, we propose a structural lifting strategy using Forman-Ricci curvature, which defines an edge-based network characteristic based on Riemannian geometry. Curvature reveals local and global properties of a graph, such as a network's backbones, i.e. coarse, structure-preserving graph geometries that form connections between major communities - most suitably represented as hyperedges to model information flows between clusters across large distances in the network. To this end, our approach provides a remedy to the problem of information distortion in message passing across long distances and graph bottlenecks - a phenomenon known in graph learning as over-squashing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Diffusion via Generalized Opinion Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11249v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in developing diffusion-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), building on the connections between message passing mechanisms in GNNs and physical diffusion processes. However, existing methods suffer from three critical limitations: (1) they rely on homogeneous diffusion with static dynamics, limiting adaptability to diverse graph structures; (2) their depth is constrained by computational overhead and diminishing interpretability; and (3) theoretical understanding of their convergence behavior remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose GODNF, a Generalized Opinion Dynamics Neural Framework, which unifies multiple opinion dynamics models into a principled, trainable diffusion mechanism. Our framework captures heterogeneous diffusion patterns and temporal dynamics via node-specific behavior modeling and dynamic neighborhood influence, while ensuring efficient and interpretable message propagation even at deep layers. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating GODNF's ability to model diverse convergence configurations. Extensive empirical evaluations of node classification and influence estimation tasks confirm GODNF's superiority over state-of-the-art GNNs.</p></details> |  |

Traditional site planning often relies on experiential judgment and single-source data, limiting systematic quantification of multifunctional layouts. We propose a Site Planning Layout Indicator (SPLI) system, a data-driven framework integrating empirical knowledge with heterogeneous multi-source data to produce structured urban spatial information. The SPLI supports multimodal spatial data systems for analytics, inference, and retrieval by combining OpenStreetMap (OSM), Points of Interest (POI), building morphology, land use, and satellite imagery. It extends conventional metrics through five dimensions: (1) Hierarchical Building Function Classification, refining empirical systems into clear hierarchies; (2) Spatial Organization, quantifying seven layout patterns (e.g., symmetrical, concentric, axial-oriented); (3) Functional Diversity, transforming qualitative assessments into measurable indicators using Functional Ratio (FR) and Simpson Index (SI); (4) Accessibility to Essential Services, integrating facility distribution and transport networks for comprehensive accessibility metrics; and (5) Land Use Intensity, using Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and Building Coverage Ratio (BCR) to assess utilization efficiency. Data gaps are addressed through deep learning, including Relational Graph Neural Networks (RGNN) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Experiments show the SPLI improves functional classification accuracy and provides a standardized basis for automated, data-driven urban spatial analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 32 figures, submitted to Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science</p></details> |
| **[A Coarse-to-Fine Human Pose Estimation Method based on Two-stage Distillation and Progressive Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11212v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation has been widely applied in the human-centric understanding and generation, but most existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate predictions. In order to obtain an accurate, robust yet lightweight human pose estimator, one feasible way is to transfer pose knowledge from a powerful teacher model to a less-parameterized student model by knowledge distillation. However, the traditional knowledge distillation framework does not fully explore the contextual information among human joints. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage knowledge distillation framework for human pose estimation. In the first-stage distillation, we introduce the human joints structure loss to mine the structural information among human joints so as to transfer high-level semantic knowledge from the teacher model to the student model. In the second-stage distillation, we utilize an Image-Guided Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) to refine the initial human pose obtained from the first-stage distillation and supervise the training of the IGP-GCN in the progressive way by the final output pose of teacher model. The extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset: COCO keypoint and CrowdPose datasets, show that our proposed method performs favorably against lots of the existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods, especially for the more complex CrowdPose dataset, the performance improvement of our model is more significant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Attention-Guided Stacked Graph Neural Networks for Malware Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09801v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malware detection in modern computing environments demands models that are not only accurate but also interpretable and robust to evasive techniques. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in this domain by modeling rich structural dependencies in graph-based program representations such as control flow graphs (CFGs). However, single-model approaches may suffer from limited generalization and lack interpretability, especially in high-stakes security applications. In this paper, we propose a novel stacking ensemble framework for graph-based malware detection and explanation. Our method dynamically extracts CFGs from portable executable (PE) files and encodes their basic blocks through a two-step embedding strategy. A set of diverse GNN base learners, each with a distinct message-passing mechanism, is used to capture complementary behavioral features. Their prediction outputs are aggregated by a meta-learner implemented as an attention-based multilayer perceptron, which both classifies malware instances and quantifies the contribution of each base model. To enhance explainability, we introduce an ensemble-aware post-hoc explanation technique that leverages edge-level importance scores generated by a GNN explainer and fuses them using the learned attention weights. This produces interpretable, model-agnostic explanations aligned with the final ensemble decision. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves classification performance while providing insightful interpretations of malware behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Fairness in Autoencoders for Node-Level Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10785v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has become an increasingly important task across various domains. With the rapid development of graph neural networks (GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements. However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed, GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data, potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection. To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose \textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods.

To address the lack of explainability of GNNs on KGs, recent works extract Datalog rules from GNNs with provable correspondence guarantees. The extracted rules can be used to explain the GNN's predictions; furthermore, they can help characterise the expressive power of various GNN models. However, these works address only a form of link prediction based on a restricted, low-expressivity graph encoding/decoding method. In this paper, we consider a more general and popular approach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN output into fact predictions. We show how GNNs and scoring functions can be adapted to be monotonic, use the monotonicity to extract sound rules for explaining predictions, and leverage existing results about the kind of rules that scoring functions can capture. We also define procedures for obtaining equivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring functions. Our experiments show that, on link prediction benchmarks, monotonic GNNs and scoring functions perform well in practice and yield many sound rules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version (with appendices) of paper accepted to KR 2025 (22nd International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning)</p></details> |

We investigate a comprehensive class of Weisfeiler-Leman variants obtained by modifying the underlying logical framework and establish a precise theoretical characterization of their expressive power. We then test two selected variants on twelve benchmark datasets that span a range of different domains. The experiments demonstrate that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art graph neural networks and graph kernels while being more time or memory efficient, depending on the dataset. We also briefly discuss directly extracting interpretable modal logic formulas from graph datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Understanding of the Dynamics of Model Capacity in Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08052v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The stability-plasticity dilemma, closely related to a neural network's (NN) capacity-its ability to represent tasks-is a fundamental challenge in continual learning (CL). Within this context, we introduce CL's effective model capacity (CLEMC) that characterizes the dynamic behavior of the stability-plasticity balance point. We develop a difference equation to model the evolution of the interplay between the NN, task data, and optimization procedure. We then leverage CLEMC to demonstrate that the effective capacity-and, by extension, the stability-plasticity balance point is inherently non-stationary. We show that regardless of the NN architecture or optimization method, a NN's ability to represent new tasks diminishes when incoming task distributions differ from previous ones. We conduct extensive experiments to support our theoretical findings, spanning a range of architectures-from small feedforward network and convolutional networks to medium-sized graph neural networks and transformer-based large language models with millions of parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[GNN-based Unified Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10583v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical imaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts arise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient populations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need to train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to match local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures such as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may require non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for irregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models coherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability, remains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that encodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a shared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified models. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them through a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and knowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and distributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two MedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified learning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and tested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large distribution shifts.

| **[DiRW: Path-Aware Digraph Learning for Heterophily](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10320v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, graph neural network (GNN) has emerged as a powerful representation learning tool for graph-structured data. However, most approaches are tailored for undirected graphs, neglecting the abundant information in the edges of directed graphs (digraphs). In fact, digraphs are widely applied in the real world and confirmed to address heterophily challenges. Despite recent advancements, existing spatial- and spectral-based DiGNNs have limitations due to their complex learning mechanisms and reliance on high-quality topology, resulting in low efficiency and unstable performance. To address these issues, we propose Directed Random Walk (DiRW), a plug-and-play strategy for most spatial-based DiGNNs and also an innovative model which offers a new digraph learning paradigm. Specifically, it utilizes a direction-aware path sampler optimized from the perspectives of walk probability, length, and number in a weight-free manner by considering node profiles and topologies. Building upon this, DiRW incorporates a node-wise learnable path aggregator for generalized node representations. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that DiRW: (1) enhances most spatial-based methods as a plug-and-play strategy; (2) achieves SOTA performance as a new digraph learning paradigm. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/dhsiuu/DiRW.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphFedMIG: Tackling Class Imbalance in Federated Graph Learning via Mutual Information-Guided Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10471v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private, decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information, hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators. By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value, minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[X-Node: Self-Explanation is All We Need](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10461v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality, clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3) guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT, and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations. Repository: https://github.com/basiralab/X-Node.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often neglect local opinion leader tendencies, resulting in overlapping influence ranges for seed nodes. Furthermore, approaches based on vanilla graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle to effectively aggregate influence characteristics during message passing, particularly with varying influence intensities. Current techniques also fail to adequately address the multi-layer nature of social networks and node heterogeneity. To address these issues, this paper proposes Inf-MDE, a novel multi-layer influence maximization method leveraging differentiated graph embedding. Inf-MDE models social relationships using a multi-layer network structure. The model extracts a self-influence propagation subgraph to eliminate the representation bias between node embeddings and propagation dynamics. Additionally, Inf-MDE incorporates an adaptive local influence aggregation mechanism within its GNN design. This mechanism dynamically adjusts influence feature aggregation during message passing based on local context and influence intensity, enabling it to effectively capture both inter-layer propagation heterogeneity and intra-layer diffusion dynamics. Extensive experiments across four distinct multi-layer social network datasets demonstrate that Inf-MDE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a graph neural network-based OIQA framework that explicitly models structural relationships between viewports to enhance perception of spatial distortion non-uniformity. Our approach employs Fibonacci sphere sampling to generate viewports with well-structured topology, representing each as a graph node. Multi-stage feature extraction networks then derive high-dimensional node representation. To holistically capture spatial dependencies, we integrate a Graph Attention Network (GAT) modeling fine-grained local distortion variations among adjacent viewports, and a graph transformer capturing long-range quality interactions across distant regions. Extensive experiments on two large-scale OIQA databases with complex spatial distortions demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, confirming its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.</p></details> |  |

Many existing solutions rely on computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

| **[Halting Recurrent GNNs and the Graded $μ$-Calculus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11050v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of machine-learning models that operate on graph-structured data. Their expressive power is intimately related to logics that are invariant under graded bisimilarity. Current proposals for recurrent GNNs either assume that the graph size is given to the model, or suffer from a lack of termination guarantees. In this paper, we propose a halting mechanism for recurrent GNNs. We prove that our halting model can express all node classifiers definable in graded modal mu-calculus, even for the standard GNN variant that is oblivious to the graph size. To prove our main result, we develop a new approximate semantics for graded mu-calculus, which we believe to be of independent interest. We leverage this new semantics into a new model-checking algorithm, called the counting algorithm, which is oblivious to the graph size. In a final step we show that the counting algorithm can be implemented on a halting recurrent GNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended technical report of paper accepted for publication at KR 2025</p></details> |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are well suited to capture structural dependencies in process data, existing GNN-based PBPM models remain underdeveloped. Most rely either on short prefix subgraphs or global architectures that overlook temporal relevance and transition semantics. We propose a unified, interpretable GNN framework that advances the state of the art along three key axes. First, we compare prefix-based Graph Convolutional Networks(GCNs) and full trace Graph Attention Networks(GATs) to quantify the performance gap between localized and global modeling. Second, we introduce a novel time decay attention mechanism that constructs dynamic, prediction-centered windows, emphasizing temporally relevant history and suppressing noise. Third, we embed transition type semantics into edge features to enable fine grained reasoning over structurally ambiguous traces. Our architecture includes multilevel interpretability modules, offering diverse visualizations of attention behavior. Evaluated on five benchmarks, the proposed models achieve competitive Top-k accuracy and DL scores without per-dataset tuning. By addressing architectural, temporal, and semantic gaps, this work presents a robust, generalizable, and explainable solution for next event prediction in PBPM.</p></details> | 32 pages |
| **[Graph Neural Network and Transformer Integration for Unsupervised System Anomaly Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09401v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection method for distributed backend service systems, addressing practical challenges such as complex structural dependencies, diverse behavioral evolution, and the absence of labeled data. The method constructs a dynamic graph based on service invocation relationships and applies graph convolution to extract high-order structural representations from multi-hop topologies. A Transformer is used to model the temporal behavior of each node, capturing long-term dependencies and local fluctuations. During the feature fusion stage, a learnable joint embedding mechanism integrates structural and behavioral representations into a unified anomaly vector. A nonlinear mapping is then applied to compute anomaly scores, enabling an end-to-end detection process without supervision. Experiments on real-world cloud monitoring data include sensitivity analyses across different graph depths, sequence lengths, and data perturbations. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing models on several key metrics, demonstrating stronger expressiveness and stability in capturing anomaly propagation paths and modeling dynamic behavior sequences, with high potential for practical deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact Verification of Graph Neural Networks with Incremental Constraint Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09320v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes applications, such as fraud detection or healthcare, but are susceptible to adversarial attacks. A number of techniques have been proposed to provide adversarial robustness guarantees, but support for commonly used aggregation functions in message-passing GNNs is still lacking. In this paper, we develop an exact (sound and complete) verification method for GNNs to compute guarantees against attribute and structural perturbations that involve edge addition or deletion, subject to budget constraints. Focusing on node classification tasks, our method employs constraint solving with bound tightening, and iteratively solves a sequence of relaxed constraint satisfaction problems while relying on incremental solving capabilities of solvers to improve efficiency. We implement GNNev, a versatile solver for message-passing neural networks, which supports three aggregation functions, sum, max and mean, with the latter two considered here for the first time. Extensive experimental evaluation of GNNev on two standard benchmarks (Cora and CiteSeer) and two real-world fraud datasets (Amazon and Yelp) demonstrates its usability and effectiveness, as well as superior performance compared to existing {exact verification} tools on sum-aggregated node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Over-Squashing in GNNs and Causal Inference of Rewiring Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09265v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance across wide-range of domains such as recommender systems, material design, and drug repurposing. Yet message-passing GNNs suffer from over-squashing -- exponential compression of long-range information from distant nodes -- which limits expressivity. Rewiring techniques can ease this bottleneck; but their practical impacts are unclear due to the lack of a direct empirical over-squashing metric. We propose a rigorous, topology-focused method for assessing over-squashing between node pairs using the decay rate of their mutual sensitivity. We then extend these pairwise assessments to four graph-level statistics (prevalence, intensity, variability, extremity). Coupling these metrics with a within-graph causal design, we quantify how rewiring strategies affect over-squashing on diverse graph- and node-classification benchmarks. Our extensive empirical analyses show that most graph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing (but to various extents), and rewiring effectively mitigates it -- though the degree of mitigation, and its translation into performance gains, varies by dataset and method. We also found that over-squashing is less notable in node classification datasets, where rewiring often increases over-squashing, and performance variations are uncorrelated with over-squashing changes. These findings suggest that rewiring is most beneficial when over-squashing is both substantial and corrected with restraint -- while overly aggressive rewiring, or rewiring applied to minimally over-squashed graphs, is unlikely to help and may even harm performance. Our plug-and-play diagnostic tool lets practitioners decide -- before any training -- whether rewiring is likely to pay off.</p></details> | 14 pages, 2 figures |

The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the hard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural network techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or how the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's characteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large, structurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard accuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42 topological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph neural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input networks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform well on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random forest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with graph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends strongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle density, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that exploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks by selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables, 7 appendices</p></details> |
| **[Blockchain Network Analysis using Quantum Inspired Graph Neural Networks & Ensemble Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09237v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the rapidly evolving domain of financial technology, the detection of illicit transactions within blockchain networks remains a critical challenge, necessitating robust and innovative solutions. This work proposes a novel approach by combining Quantum Inspired Graph Neural Networks (QI-GNN) with flexibility of choice of an Ensemble Model using QBoost or a classic model such as Random Forrest Classifier. This system is tailored specifically for blockchain network analysis in anti-money laundering (AML) efforts. Our methodology to design this system incorporates a novel component, a Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition layer within the graph neural network framework, enhancing its capability to process and analyze complex data structures efficiently. Our technical approach has undergone rigorous evaluation against classical machine learning implementations, achieving an F2 score of 74.8% in detecting fraudulent transactions. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired techniques, supplemented by the structural advancements of the CP layer, to not only match but potentially exceed traditional methods in complex network analysis for financial security. The findings advocate for a broader adoption and further exploration of quantum-inspired algorithms within the financial sector to effectively combat fraud.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScamDetect: Towards a Robust, Agnostic Framework to Uncover Threats in Smart Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07094v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts have transformed decentralized finance by enabling programmable, trustless transactions. However, their widespread adoption and growing financial significance have attracted persistent and sophisticated threats, such as phishing campaigns and contract-level exploits. Traditional transaction-based threat detection methods often expose sensitive user data and interactions, raising privacy and security concerns. In response, static bytecode analysis has emerged as a proactive mitigation strategy, identifying malicious contracts before they execute harmful actions. Building on this approach, we introduced PhishingHook, the first machine-learning-based framework for detecting phishing activities in smart contracts via static bytecode and opcode analysis, achieving approximately 90% detection accuracy. Nevertheless, two pressing challenges remain: (1) the increasing use of sophisticated bytecode obfuscation techniques designed to evade static analysis, and (2) the heterogeneity of blockchain environments requiring platform-agnostic solutions. This paper presents a vision for ScamDetect (Smart Contract Agnostic Malware Detector), a robust, modular, and platform-agnostic framework for smart contract malware detection. Over the next 2.5 years, ScamDetect will evolve in two stages: first, by tackling obfuscated Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode through graph neural network (GNN) analysis of control flow graphs (CFGs), leveraging GNNs' ability to capture complex structural patterns beyond opcode sequences; and second, by generalizing detection capabilities to emerging runtimes such as WASM. ScamDetect aims to enable proactive, scalable security for the future of decentralized ecosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiated Information Mining: A Semi-supervised Learning Framework for GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08769v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In semi-supervised learning (SSL) for enhancing the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) with unlabeled data, introducing mutually independent decision factors for cross-validation is regarded as an effective strategy to alleviate pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse. However, obtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid information sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are available, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To address this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor Consistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated factors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During pre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it iteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels based on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to reduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based methods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In this work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent textual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability scoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by these auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label regimes, outperforming other baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

The iterative hybrid mechanism integrates the proposed Node-Destroyer Model, a machine learning hybrid model that utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such identifies and selects customer nodes to guide the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operator within the metaheuristic optimization frameworks. This model leverages the structural properties of the problem and solution that can be represented as a graph, to guide strategic selections concerning node removal. The proposed approach reduces operational complexity and scales down the search space involved in the optimization process. The hybrid approach is applied specifically to the CVRP and does not require retraining across problem instances of different sizes. The proposed hybrid mechanism is able to improve the performance of baseline metaheuristic algorithms. Our approach not only enhances the solution quality for standard CVRP benchmarks but also proves scalability on very large-scale instances with up to 30,000 customer nodes. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid mechanism is capable of improving different baseline algorithms, achieving better quality of solutions under similar settings.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |

Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that $\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced reasoning processes.</p></details> | IJCAI 2025 |
| **[Edge-Selector Model Applied for Local Search Neighborhood for Solving Vehicle Routing Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14071v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research proposes a hybrid Machine Learning and metaheuristic mechanism that is designed to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). The main of our method is an edge solution selector model, which classifies solution edges to identify prohibited moves during the local search, hence guiding the search process within metaheuristic baselines. Two learning-based mechanisms are used to develop the edge selector: a simple tabular binary classifier and a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The tabular classifier employs Gradient Boosting Trees and Feedforward Neural Network as the baseline algorithms. Adjustments to the decision threshold are also applied to handle the class imbalance in the problem instance. An alternative mechanism employs the GNN to utilize graph structure for direct solution edge prediction, with the objective of guiding local search by predicting prohibited moves. These hybrid mechanisms are then applied in state-fo-the-art metaheuristic baselines. Our method demonstrates both scalability and generalizability, achieving performance improvements across different baseline metaheuristics, various problem sizes and variants, including the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and CVRP with Time Windows (CVRPTW). Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets up to 30,000 customer nodes, supported by pair-wise statistical analysis, verify the observed improvements.</p></details> | 29 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Combat Urban Congestion via Collaboration: Heterogeneous GNN-based MARL for Coordinated Platooning and Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10948v3)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the years, reinforcement learning has emerged as a popular approach to develop signal control and vehicle platooning strategies either independently or in a hierarchical way. However, jointly controlling both in real-time to alleviate traffic congestion presents new challenges, such as the inherent physical and behavioral heterogeneity between signal control and platooning, as well as coordination between them. This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale; 3) applying alternating optimization for training, allowing agents to update their own policies and adapt to other agents' policies. We evaluate our approach through SUMO simulations, which show convergent results in terms of both travel time and fuel consumption, and superior performance compared to other adaptive signal control methods.</p></details> |  |

These models are trained on fleet movement data, including robot positions, goals, and interactions, from hundreds of thousands of robots in Amazon warehouses worldwide. DeepFleet consists of four architectures that each embody a distinct inductive bias and collectively explore key points in the design space for multi-agent foundation models: the robot-centric (RC) model is an autoregressive decision transformer operating on neighborhoods of individual robots; the robot-floor (RF) model uses a transformer with cross-attention between robots and the warehouse floor; the image-floor (IF) model applies convolutional encoding to a multi-channel image representation of the full fleet; and the graph-floor (GF) model combines temporal attention with graph neural networks for spatial relationships. In this paper, we describe these models and present our evaluation of the impact of these design choices on prediction task performance. We find that the robot-centric and graph-floor models, which both use asynchronous robot state updates and incorporate the localized structure of robot interactions, show the most promise. We also present experiments that show that these two models can make effective use of larger warehouses operation datasets as the models are scaled up.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In recent years, researchers have made significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic, i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty, leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes), thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and (ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5% improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, SIGSPATIAL 2025</p></details> |

We introduce the Intersecting Block Graph (IBG), a low-rank factorization of large directed graphs based on combinations of intersecting bipartite components, each consisting of a pair of communities, for source and target nodes. By giving less weight to non-edges, we show how to efficiently approximate any graph, sparse or dense, by a dense IBG. Specifically, we prove a constructive version of the weak regularity lemma, showing that for any chosen accuracy, every graph, regardless of its size or sparsity, can be approximated by a dense IBG whose rank depends only on the accuracy. This dependence of the rank solely on the accuracy, and not on the sparsity level, is in contrast to previous forms of the weak regularity lemma. We present a graph neural network architecture operating on the IBG representation of the graph and demonstrating competitive performance on node classification, spatio-temporal graph analysis, and knowledge graph completion, while having memory and computational complexity linear in the number of nodes rather than edges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Diffusion-Based Model-Level Explanation of Heterogeneous GNNs with Node Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08458v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction. Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features (e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space, whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Through an extensive analysis of relevant studies, it is found that there is a lack of research work concerning algorithm selection oriented toward the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP). In this work, we propose a learning-based framework that integrates both traditional machine learning and graph neural networks to address this gap. We construct a labeled dataset by running four exact MCP algorithms on a diverse collection of graph instances, accompanied by structural and global statistical features extracted from each graph. We first evaluate four conventional classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), across multiple dataset variants. Experimental results show that RF consistently shows strong performance across metrics and dataset variants, making it a reliable baseline. In addition, feature importance analysis indicates that connectivity and topological structure are strong predictors of algorithm performance. Building on these findings, we develop a dual-channel model named GAT-MLP, which combines a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for local structural encoding with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for global feature modeling. The GAT-MLP model shows strong and consistent performance across all metrics. Our results highlight the effectiveness of dual-channel architectures and the promise of graph neural networks in combinatorial algorithm selection.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

In HGNN inference, the neighbor aggregation stage is the primary performance determinant, yet it suffers from two major sources of memory inefficiency. First, the commonly adopted per-semantic execution paradigm stores intermediate aggregation results for each semantic prior to semantic fusion, causing substantial memory expansion. Second, the aggregation process incurs extensive redundant memory accesses, including repeated loading of target vertex features across semantics and repeated accesses to shared neighbors due to cross-semantic neighborhood overlap. These inefficiencies severely limit scalability and reduce HGNN inference performance. In this work, we first propose a semantics-complete execution paradigm from a vertex perspective that eliminates per-semantic intermediate storage and redundant target vertex accesses. Building on this paradigm, we design TVL-HGNN, a reconfigurable hardware accelerator optimized for efficient aggregation. In addition, we introduce a vertex grouping technique based on cross-semantic neighborhood overlap, with hardware implementation, to reduce redundant accesses to shared neighbors. Experimental results demonstrate that TVL-HGNN achieves average speedups of 7.85x and 1.41x over the NVIDIA A100 GPU and the state-of-the-art HGNN accelerator HiHGNN, respectively, while reducing energy consumption by 98.79% and 32.61%.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, accepted by ICCD 2025</p></details> |

However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness -- some nodes are rich in information, while others remain sparse. Second, predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose Retrieval-augmented Graph Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph. ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings using a frozen LLM backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of agentic planning and local-global retrieval in graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, work in progress</p></details> |
