| **[AnoF-Diff: One-Step Diffusion-Based Anomaly Detection for Forceful Tool Use](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15153v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time-series anomaly detection, which is critical for identifying unexpected events, has been explored in the field of machine learning for several decades. However, directly applying these methods to data from forceful tool use tasks is challenging because streaming sensor data in the real world tends to be inherently noisy, exhibits non-stationary behavior, and varies across different tasks and tools. To address these challenges, we propose a method, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque features from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect anomalies. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods in terms of F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) on four forceful tool-use tasks, demonstrating that our method has better performance and is more robust to a noisy dataset. We also propose the method of parallel anomaly score evaluation based on one-step diffusion and demonstrate how our method can be used for online anomaly detection in several forceful tool use experiments.</p></details> |  |

Large pre-trained models such as Chronos and Time-MoE show strong zero-shot (ZS) performance but suffer from high computational costs. In this work, We introduce Super-Linear, a lightweight and scalable mixture-of-experts (MoE) model for general forecasting. It replaces deep architectures with simple frequency-specialized linear experts, trained on resampled data across multiple frequency regimes. A lightweight spectral gating mechanism dynamically selects relevant experts, enabling efficient, accurate forecasting. Despite its simplicity, Super-Linear matches state-of-the-art performance while offering superior efficiency, robustness to various sampling rates, and enhanced interpretability. The implementation of Super-Linear is available at \href{https://github.com/azencot-group/SuperLinear}{https://github.com/azencot-group/SuperLinear}</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Internet Traffic Matrix Prediction via Time Series Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15072v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel framework that leverages time series clustering to improve internet traffic matrix (TM) prediction using deep learning (DL) models. Traffic flows within a TM often exhibit diverse temporal behaviors, which can hinder prediction accuracy when training a single model across all flows. To address this, we propose two clustering strategies, source clustering and histogram clustering, that group flows with similar temporal patterns prior to model training. Clustering creates more homogeneous data subsets, enabling models to capture underlying patterns more effectively and generalize better than global prediction approaches that fit a single model to the entire TM. Compared to existing TM prediction methods, our method reduces RMSE by up to 92\% for Abilene and 75\% for G\'EANT. In routing scenarios, our clustered predictions also reduce maximum link utilization (MLU) bias by 18\% and 21\%, respectively, demonstrating the practical benefits of clustering when TMs are used for network optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICMLA 2025</p></details> |
| **[From Patterns to Predictions: A Shapelet-Based Framework for Directional Forecasting in Noisy Financial Markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15040v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directional forecasting in financial markets requires both accuracy and interpretability. Before the advent of deep learning, interpretable approaches based on human-defined patterns were prevalent, but their structural vagueness and scale ambiguity hindered generalization. In contrast, deep learning models can effectively capture complex dynamics, yet often offer limited transparency. To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage framework that integrates unsupervised pattern extracion with interpretable forecasting. (i) SIMPC segments and clusters multivariate time series, extracting recurrent patterns that are invariant to amplitude scaling and temporal distortion, even under varying window sizes. (ii) JISC-Net is a shapelet-based classifier that uses the initial part of extracted patterns as input and forecasts subsequent partial sequences for short-term directional movement. Experiments on Bitcoin and three S&P 500 equities demonstrate that our method ranks first or second in 11 out of 12 metric--dataset combinations, consistently outperforming baselines. Unlike conventional deep learning models that output buy-or-sell signals without interpretable justification, our approach enables transparent decision-making by revealing the underlying pattern structures that drive predictive outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, accepted at ACM CIKM 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Marginals: Learning Joint Spatio-Temporal Patterns for Multivariate Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15033v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we aim to improve multivariate anomaly detection (AD) by modeling the \textit{time-varying non-linear spatio-temporal correlations} found in multivariate time series data . In multivariate time series data, an anomaly may be indicated by the simultaneous deviation of interrelated time series from their expected collective behavior, even when no individual time series exhibits a clearly abnormal pattern on its own. In many existing approaches, time series variables are assumed to be (conditionally) independent, which oversimplifies real-world interactions. Our approach addresses this by modeling joint dependencies in the latent space and decoupling the modeling of \textit{marginal distributions, temporal dynamics, and inter-variable dependencies}. We use a transformer encoder to capture temporal patterns, and to model spatial (inter-variable) dependencies, we fit a multi-variate likelihood and a copula. The temporal and the spatial components are trained jointly in a latent space using a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to learn meaningful feature representations to separate normal and anomaly samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Warp Quantification Analysis: A Framework For Path-based Signal Alignment Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14994v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic time warping (DTW) is widely used to align time series evolving on mismatched timescales, yet most applications reduce alignment to a scalar distance. We introduce warp quantification analysis (WQA), a framework that derives interpretable geometric and structural descriptors from DTW paths. Controlled simulations showed that each metric selectively tracked its intended driver with minimal crosstalk. Applied to large-scale fMRI, WQA revealed distinct network signatures and complementary associations with schizophrenia negative symptom severity, capturing clinically meaningful variability beyond DTW distance. WQA transforms DTW from a single-score method into a family of alignment descriptors, offering a principled and generalizable extension for richer characterization of temporal coupling across domains where nonlinear normalization is essential.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[DAG: A Dual Causal Network for Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14933v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is crucial in various fields such as economics, traffic, and AIOps. However, in real-world applications, focusing solely on the endogenous variables (i.e., target variables), is often insufficient to ensure accurate predictions. Considering exogenous variables (i.e., covariates) provides additional predictive information, thereby improving forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods for time series forecasting with exogenous variables (TSF-X) have the following shortcomings: 1) they do not leverage future exogenous variables, 2) they fail to account for the causal relationships between endogenous and exogenous variables. As a result, their performance is suboptimal. In this study, to better leverage exogenous variables, especially future exogenous variable, we propose a general framework DAG, which utilizes dual causal network along both the temporal and channel dimensions for time series forecasting with exogenous variables. Specifically, we first introduce the Temporal Causal Module, which includes a causal discovery module to capture how historical exogenous variables affect future exogenous variables. Following this, we construct a causal injection module that incorporates the discovered causal relationships into the process of forecasting future endogenous variables based on historical endogenous variables. Next, we propose the Channel Causal Module, which follows a similar design principle. It features a causal discovery module models how historical exogenous variables influence historical endogenous variables, and a causal injection module incorporates the discovered relationships to enhance the prediction of future endogenous variables based on future exogenous variables.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPANet: Dual Pyramid Attention Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14868v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We conducted rigorous ablation studies to validate DPANet's key components (Table \ref{tab:ablation-study}). The full model consistently outperforms all variants. To test our dual-domain hypothesis, we designed two specialized versions: a Temporal-Only model (fusing two identical temporal pyramids) and a Frequency-Only model (fusing two spectral pyramids). Both variants underperformed significantly, confirming that the fusion of heterogeneous temporal and frequency information is critical. Furthermore, replacing the cross-attention mechanism with a simpler method (w/o Cross-Fusion) caused the most severe performance degradation. This result underscores that our interactive fusion block is the most essential component.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Based Scenario Tree Generation for Multivariate Time Series Prediction and Multistage Stochastic Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14832v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic forecasting is critical for efficient decision-making in uncertain systems, such as energy markets and finance, where estimating the full distribution of future scenarios is essential. We propose Diffusion Scenario Tree (DST), a general framework for constructing scenario trees for multivariate prediction tasks using diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting models. DST recursively samples future trajectories and organizes them into a tree via clustering, ensuring non-anticipativity (decisions depending only on observed history) at each stage. We evaluate the framework on the optimization task of energy arbitrage in New York State's day-ahead electricity market. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms the same optimization algorithms that use scenario trees from more conventional models and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning baselines. Furthermore, using DST for stochastic optimization yields more efficient decision policies, achieving higher performance by better handling uncertainty than deterministic and stochastic MPC variants using the same diffusion-based forecaster.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, and 1 algorithm.

| **[Forecasting in small open emerging economies Evidence from Thailand](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14805v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting inflation in small open economies is difficult because limited time series and strong external exposures create an imbalance between few observations and many potential predictors. We study this challenge using Thailand as a representative case, combining more than 450 domestic and international indicators. We evaluate modern Bayesian shrinkage and factor models, including Horseshoe regressions, factor-augmented autoregressions, factor-augmented VARs, dynamic factor models, and Bayesian additive regression trees. Our results show that factor models dominate at short horizons, when global shocks and exchange rate movements drive inflation, while shrinkage-based regressions perform best at longer horizons. These models not only improve point and density forecasts but also enhance tail-risk performance at the one-year horizon. Shrinkage diagnostics, on the other hand, additionally reveal that Google Trends variables, especially those related to food essential goods and housing costs, progressively rotate into predictive importance as the horizon lengthens. This underscores their role as forward-looking indicators of household inflation expectations in small open economies.</p></details> |  |
| **[DualSG: A Dual-Stream Explicit Semantic-Guided Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21830v4)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications. Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively, methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs, rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation. Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025 (ACM MM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[DeCoP: Enhancing Self-Supervised Time Series Representation with Dependency Controlled Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14642v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling dynamic temporal dependencies is a critical challenge in time series pre-training, which evolve due to distribution shifts and multi-scale patterns. This temporal variability severely impairs the generalization of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Existing frameworks fail to capture the complex interactions of short- and long-term dependencies, making them susceptible to spurious correlations that degrade generalization. To address these limitations, we propose DeCoP, a Dependency Controlled Pre-training framework that explicitly models dynamic, multi-scale dependencies by simulating evolving inter-patch dependencies. At the input level, DeCoP introduces Instance-wise Patch Normalization (IPN) to mitigate distributional shifts while preserving the unique characteristics of each patch, creating a robust foundation for representation learning. At the latent level, a hierarchical Dependency Controlled Learning (DCL) strategy explicitly models inter-patch dependencies across multiple temporal scales, with an Instance-level Contrastive Module (ICM) enhances global generalization by learning instance-discriminative representations from time-invariant positive pairs. DeCoP achieves state-of-the-art results on ten datasets with lower computing resources, improving MSE by 3% on ETTh1 over PatchTST using only 37% of the FLOPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[DyWPE: Signal-Aware Dynamic Wavelet Positional Encoding for Time Series Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14640v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing positional encoding methods in transformers are fundamentally signal-agnostic, deriving positional information solely from sequence indices while ignoring the underlying signal characteristics. This limitation is particularly problematic for time series analysis, where signals exhibit complex, non-stationary dynamics across multiple temporal scales. We introduce Dynamic Wavelet Positional Encoding (DyWPE), a novel signal-aware framework that generates positional embeddings directly from input time series using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Comprehensive experiments in ten diverse time series datasets demonstrate that DyWPE consistently outperforms eight existing state-of-the-art positional encoding methods, achieving average relative improvements of 9.1\% compared to baseline sinusoidal absolute position encoding in biomedical signals, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[AR-KAN: Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02967v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional neural networks struggle to capture the spectral structure of complex signals. Fourier neural networks (FNNs) attempt to address this by embedding Fourier series components, yet many real-world signals are almost-periodic with non-commensurate frequencies, posing additional challenges. Building on prior work showing that ARIMA outperforms large language models (LLMs) for forecasting, we extend the comparison to neural predictors and find ARIMA still superior. We therefore propose the Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (AR-KAN), which integrates a pre-trained AR module for temporal memory with a KAN for nonlinear representation. The AR module preserves essential temporal features while reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that AR-KAN matches ARIMA on almost-periodic functions and achieves the best results on $72\%$ of Rdatasets series, with a clear advantage on data with periodic structure. These results highlight AR-KAN as a robust and effective framework for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identification and Estimation of Multi-order Tensor Factor Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13418v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework in high-dimensional factor models to simultaneously analyse multiple tensor time series, each with potentially different tensor orders and dimensionality. The connection between different tensor time series is through their global factors that are correlated to each other. A salient feature of our model is that when all tensor time series have the same order, it can be regarded as an extension of multilevel factor models from vectors to general tensors. Under very mild conditions, we separate the global and local components in the proposed model. Parameter estimation is thoroughly discussed, including a consistent factor number estimator. With strong correlation between global factors and noise allowed, we derive the rates of convergence of our estimators, which can be more superior than those of existing methods for multilevel factor models. We also develop estimators that are more computationally efficient, with rates of convergence spelt out. Extensive experiments are performed under various settings, corroborating with the pronounced theoretical results. As a real application example, we analyse a set of taxi data to study the traffic flow between Times Squares and its neighbouring areas.</p></details> | 45 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Nonlinear Causality in Time Series Networks: With Application to Motor Imagery vs Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10374v3)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal interactions in time series networks can be dynamic and nonlinear, making it difficult to identify them using conventional linear causality estimations. We propose a novel approach, called Threshold Autoregressive Modeling for Causality (TAR4C), a causality detection approach built on threshold autoregressive (TAR) models, where a potential driver (cause variable) acts both as a predictor and as a trigger (switching threshold) that governs which autoregressive process the target (effect variable) follows. Threshold nonlinearity is conceptualized here to determine causality. The flow of the target is forced to transition between regimes with distinct dynamics when the driver exceeds a data-driven threshold in the past. We propose a two-stage inference procedure: Stage 1 tests for threshold connectivity (TC); Stage 2, conditional on a detected threshold effect, estimates threshold Granger causality (TGC). TAR4C is applied to a multichannel EEG dataset collected from a motor imagery and execution experiment. Delay-dependent directional interactions are observed among channels across different sites of the EEG map. The real-world application demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed approach for determining nonlinear causal connectivity in complex time-series networks, such as brain circuitry. The proposed model-based methodology extends to other complex networks of time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Past and Future: Distribution-Aware Alignment for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14181v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning techniques like contrastive learning have long been explored in time series forecasting, mirroring their success in computer vision and natural language processing. Yet recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasters seldom adopt these representation approaches because they have shown little performance advantage. We challenge this view and demonstrate that explicit representation alignment can supply critical information that bridges the distributional gap between input histories and future targets. To this end, we introduce TimeAlign, a lightweight, plug-and-play framework that learns auxiliary features via a simple reconstruction task and feeds them back to any base forecaster. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify its superior performance. Further studies indicate that the gains arises primarily from correcting frequency mismatches between historical inputs and future outputs. We also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of TimeAlign in increasing the mutual information between learned representations and predicted targets. As it is architecture-agnostic and incurs negligible overhead, TimeAlign can serve as a general alignment module for modern deep learning time-series forecasting systems. The code is available at https://github.com/TROUBADOUR000/TimeAlign.</p></details> |  |
| **[Canonical correlation analysis of stochastic trends via functional approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19572v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel approach for semiparametric inference on the number $s$ of common trends and their loading matrix $\psi$ in $I(1)/I(0)$ systems. It combines functional approximation of limits of random walks and canonical correlations analysis, performed between the $p$ observed time series of length $T$ and the first $K$ discretized elements of an $L^2$ basis. Tests and selection criteria on $s$, and estimators and tests on $\psi$ are proposed; their properties are discussed as $T$ and $K$ diverge sequentially for fixed $p$ and $s$. It is found that tests on $s$ are asymptotically pivotal, selection criteria of $s$ are consistent, estimators of $\psi$ are $T$-consistent, mixed-Gaussian and efficient, so that Wald tests on $\psi$ are asymptotically Normal or $\chi^2$. The paper also discusses asymptotically pivotal misspecification tests for checking model assumptions. The approach can be coherently applied to subsets or aggregations of variables in a given panel. Monte Carlo simulations show that these tools have reasonable performance for $T\geq 10 p$ and $p\leq 300$. An empirical analysis of 20 exchange rates illustrates the methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-ABBA: Understanding time series via symbolic approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18506v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of large language models (LLMs) for time series has been demonstrated in previous work. Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to \kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoVariance Filters and Neural Networks over Hilbert Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13178v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform graph convolutions on the empirical covariance matrix of signals defined over finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, motivated by robustness and transferability properties. Yet, little is known about how these arguments extend to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In this work, we take a first step by introducing a novel convolutional learning framework for signals defined over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, centered on the (empirical) covariance operator. We constructively define Hilbert coVariance Filters (HVFs) and design Hilbert coVariance Networks (HVNs) as stacks of HVF filterbanks with nonlinear activations. We propose a principled discretization procedure, and we prove that empirical HVFs can recover the Functional PCA (FPCA) of the filtered signals. We then describe the versatility of our framework with examples ranging from multivariate real-valued functions to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Finally, we validate HVNs on both synthetic and real-world time-series classification tasks, showing robust performance compared to MLP and FPCA-based classifiers.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Deep Temporal Graph Networks for Real-Time Correction of GNSS Jamming-Induced Deviations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14000v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are increasingly disrupted by intentional jamming, degrading availability precisely when positioning and timing must remain operational. We address this by reframing jamming mitigation as dynamic graph regression and introducing a receiver-centric deep temporal graph network that predicts, and thus corrects, the receivers horizontal deviation in real time. At each 1 Hz epoch, the satellite receiver environment is represented as a heterogeneous star graph (receiver center, tracked satellites as leaves) with time varying attributes (e.g., SNR, azimuth, elevation, latitude/longitude). A single layer Heterogeneous Graph ConvLSTM (HeteroGCLSTM) aggregates one hop spatial context and temporal dynamics over a short history to output the 2D deviation vector applied for on the fly correction. We evaluate on datasets from two distinct receivers under three jammer profiles, continuous wave (cw), triple tone (cw3), and wideband FM, each exercised at six power levels between -45 and -70 dBm, with 50 repetitions per scenario (prejam/jam/recovery). Against strong multivariate time series baselines (MLP, uniform CNN, and Seq2Point CNN), our model consistently attains the lowest mean absolute error (MAE). At -45 dBm, it achieves 3.64 cm (GP01/cw), 7.74 cm (GP01/cw3), 4.41 cm (ublox/cw), 4.84 cm (ublox/cw3), and 4.82 cm (ublox/FM), improving to 1.65-2.08 cm by -60 to -70 dBm. On mixed mode datasets pooling all powers, MAE is 3.78 cm (GP01) and 4.25 cm (ublox10), outperforming Seq2Point, MLP, and CNN. A split study shows superior data efficiency: with only 10\% training data our approach remains well ahead of baselines (20 cm vs. 36-42 cm).</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Day-Ahead Transmission Grid Topology Optimization Considering Renewable Energy Sources' Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13994v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing renewable penetration introduces significant uncertainty in power system operations. At the same time, the existing transmission grid is often already congested, and urgently needed reinforcements are frequently delayed due to several constraints. To address these challenges, adjusting the grid topology based on congestion patterns is considered a non-costly remedy to guarantee efficient power transmission. Based on this idea, this paper proposes a grid topology optimization model combining optimal transmission switching and busbar splitting for AC and hybrid AC/DC grids. The methodology incorporates RES forecast uncertainty through a scenario-based stochastic optimization approach, using real offshore wind data and K-means clustering to generate representative forecast error scenarios. The proposed model includes several formulations to be compared with a plain optimal power flow (OPF) model: hourly optimizing the topology, one topology for 24 hours, or a limited number of switching actions over a day. The grid topology optimization model is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Convex Problem, optimized based on the day-ahead (D-1) RES forecast and validated for AC-feasibility via an AC-OPF formulation. Based on the generation setpoints of the feasibility check, a redispatch simulation based on the measured (D) RES realization is then computed. The methodology is tested on an AC 30-bus test case and a hybrid AC/DC 50-bus test case, for a 24-hours (30-bus) and a 14-days (both test cases) time series. The results highlight the economic benefits brought by grid topology optimization for congested test cases with high penetration of RES. In addition, the results demonstrate that accounting for RES uncertainty with at least 6 to 8 scenarios leads to lower or comparable total costs to deterministic day-ahead forecasts, even when limiting the frequency of topological actions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ensembled Direct Multi Step forecasting methodology with comparison on macroeconomic and financial data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13945v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasts of macroeconomic and financial data, such as GDP, CPI, unemployment rates, and stock indices, are crucial for the success of countries, businesses, and investors, resulting in a constant demand for reliable forecasting models. This research introduces a novel methodology for time series forecasting that combines Ensemble technique with a Direct Multi-Step (DMS) forecasting procedure. This Ensembled Direct Multi-Step (EDMS) approach not only leverages the strengths of both techniques but also capitalizes on their synergy. The ensemble models were selected based on performance, complexity, and computational resource requirements, encompassing a full spectrum of model complexities, from simple Linear and Polynomial Regression to medium-complexity ETS and complex LSTM models. Ensembling is carried out using weights derived from each model's performance. The DMS procedure limits retraining to one- and five-year forecasts for economic data and one- and five-month forecasts for financial data. The standard Iterative Multi-Step (IMS) procedure is employed for other horizons, effectively reducing computational demands while maintaining satisfactory results. The proposed methodology is benchmarked against the Ensemble technique conventionally applied to IMS-generated forecasts, utilizing several publicly available macroeconomic datasets, including GDP, CPI, and employment figures across selected countries, and common financial indices data. Results demonstrate a significant performance improvement with the EDMS methodology, averaging a 33.32% enhancement across the analysed datasets, and sometimes reaching improvement above 60%.</p></details> | 40 pages, 7 figures |
| **[TFMAdapter: Lightweight Instance-Level Adaptation of Foundation Models for Forecasting with Covariates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13906v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in univariate forecasting on new time series simply by conditioned on a brief history of past values. Their success demonstrates that large-scale pretraining across diverse domains can acquire the inductive bias to generalize from temporal patterns in a brief history. However, most TSFMs are unable to leverage covariates -- future-available exogenous variables critical for accurate forecasting in many applications -- due to their domain-specific nature and the lack of associated inductive bias. We propose TFMAdapter, a lightweight, instance-level adapter that augments TSFMs with covariate information without fine-tuning. Instead of retraining, TFMAdapter operates on the limited history provided during a single model call, learning a non-parametric cascade that combines covariates with univariate TSFM forecasts. However, such learning would require univariate forecasts at all steps in the history, requiring too many calls to the TSFM. To enable training on the full historical context while limiting TSFM invocations, TFMAdapter uses a two-stage method: (1) generating pseudo-forecasts with a simple regression model, and (2) training a Gaussian Process regressor to refine predictions using both pseudo- and TSFM forecasts alongside covariates. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TFMAdapter consistently outperforms both foundation models and supervised baselines, achieving a 24-27\% improvement over base foundation models with minimal data and computational overhead. Our results highlight the potential of lightweight adapters to bridge the gap between generic foundation models and domain-specific forecasting needs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CIKM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Prediction and Causality of functional MRI and synthetic signal using a Zero-Shot Time-Series Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12497v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting and causal discovery are central in neuroscience, as predicting brain activity and identifying causal relationships between neural populations and circuits can shed light on the mechanisms underlying cognition and disease. With the rise of foundation models, an open question is how they compare to traditional methods for brain signal forecasting and causality analysis, and whether they can be applied in a zero-shot setting. In this work, we evaluate a foundation model against classical methods for inferring directional interactions from spontaneous brain activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Traditional approaches often rely on Wiener-Granger causality. We tested the forecasting ability of the foundation model in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and assessed causality by comparing Granger-like estimates from the model with standard Granger causality. We validated the approach using synthetic time series generated from ground-truth causal models, including logistic map coupling and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The foundation model achieved competitive zero-shot forecasting fMRI time series (mean absolute percentage error of 0.55 in controls and 0.27 in patients). Although standard Granger causality did not show clear quantitative differences between models, the foundation model provided a more precise detection of causal interactions. Overall, these findings suggest that foundation models offer versatility, strong zero-shot performance, and potential utility for forecasting and causal discovery in time-series data.</p></details> |  |

Conventional approaches typically determine success or failure after the action has been carried out. However, they make it difficult to prevent potential hazards and rely on failures to trigger replanning, thereby reducing the efficiency of object manipulation sequences. To overcome these challenges, we propose a model, which predicts the alignment between a pre-manipulation egocentric image with the planned trajectory and a given natural language instruction. We introduce a Multi-Level Trajectory Fusion module, which employs a state-of-the-art deep state-space model and a transformer encoder in parallel to capture multi-level time-series self-correlation within the end effector trajectory. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperformed existing methods, including foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Advanced Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Empowering Time Series Analysis with Foundation Models: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02358v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data are ubiquitous across diverse real-world applications, making time series analysis critically important. Traditional approaches are largely task-specific, offering limited functionality and poor transferability. In recent years, foundation models have revolutionized NLP and CV with their remarkable cross-task transferability, zero-/few-shot learning capabilities, and multimodal integration capacity. This success has motivated increasing efforts to explore foundation models for addressing time series modeling challenges. Although some tutorials and surveys were published in the early stages of this field, the rapid pace of recent developments necessitates a more comprehensive and in-depth synthesis to cover the latest advances. Our survey aims to fill this gap by introducing a modality-aware, challenge-oriented perspective, which reveals how foundation models pre-trained on different modalities face distinct hurdles when adapted to time series tasks. Building on this perspective, we propose a taxonomy of existing works organized by pre-training modality (time series, language, and vision), analyze modality-specific challenges and categorize corresponding solutions, discussing their advantages and limitations. Beyond this, we review real-world applications to illustrate domain-specific advancements, provide open-source codes, and conclude with potential future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 fi...</summary><p>10 figures, 5 tables, 20 pages</p></details> |

To address these challenges, various strategies, such as self-supervised learning, have been suggested, but they typically rely on extensive empirical datasets. Inspired by recent advances in computer vision, we propose a pretraining task termed "frequency pretraining" to pretrain a neural network for sleep staging by predicting the frequency content of randomly generated synthetic time series. Our experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses fully supervised learning in scenarios with limited data and few subjects, and matches its performance in regimes with many subjects. Furthermore, our results underline the relevance of frequency information for sleep stage scoring, while also demonstrating that deep neural networks utilize information beyond frequencies to enhance sleep staging performance, which is consistent with previous research. We anticipate that our approach will be advantageous across a broad spectrum of applications where EEG data is limited or derived from a small number of subjects, including the domain of brain-computer interfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

The goal is to analyze how the distribution of a biomarker, such as glucose, changes over time and how these changes may reflect the progression of chronic diseases such as diabetes. We introduce a probabilistic model based on a Gaussian mixture that captures the evolution of a continuous-time stochastic process. Our approach combines a nonparametric estimate of the distribution, obtained with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), and a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) that governs the temporal evolution of the mixture weights. The model is highly interpretable, detects subtle distribution shifts, and remains computationally efficient. We illustrate the broad utility of our approach in a 26-week clinical trial that treats all continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) time series as the primary outcome. This method enables rigorous longitudinal comparisons between the treatment and control arms and yields characterizations that conventional summary-based clinical trials analytical methods typically do not capture.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Stable Measure for Conditional Periodicity of Time Series using Persistent Homology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02817v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a pair of time series, we study how the periodicity of one influences the periodicity of the other. There are several known methods to measure the similarity between a pair of time series, but we have yet to find any measures with theoretical stability results. Persistence homology has been utilized to construct a scoring function with theoretical guarantees of stability that quantifies the periodicity of a single univariate time series f1, denoted score(f1). Building on this concept, we propose a conditional periodicity score that quantifies the periodicity similarity of two univariate time series, denoted score(f1|f2), and derive theoretical stability results for the same. We prove stability of score(f1|f2) under orthogonal projection of the time series embeddings onto their first K principal components. We show that the change in our score is bounded by a function of the eigenvalues corresponding to the remaining (unused) N-K principal components and hence is small when the first K principal components capture most of the variation in the time series embeddings. We derive a lower bound on the embedding dimension to use in our pipeline which guarantees that any two such embeddings produce scores that are linearly within epsilon of each other. We present a procedure for computing conditional periodicity scores and implement it on several types of synthetic signals. We experimentally compare our similarity measure to the most-similar statistical measure of percent determinism (%DET) and show greater stability of score(f1|f2). We also compare both measures on several pairs of real time series describing monthly proportions of incoming calls to a police agency and highlight the decreased stability of %DET on the same.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Feedback Discovery using Convergence Cross Mapping on Sea Ice Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09001v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying causal relationships in climate systems remains challenging due to nonlinear, coupled dynamics that limit the effectiveness of linear and stochastic causal discovery approaches. This study benchmarks Convergence Cross Mapping (CCM) against Granger causality, PCMCI, and VarLiNGAM using both synthetic datasets with ground truth causal links and 41 years of Arctic climate data (1979--2021). Unlike stochastic models that rely on autoregressive residual dependence, CCM leverages Takens' state-space reconstruction and delay-embedding to reconstruct attractor manifolds from time series. Cross mapping between reconstructed manifolds exploits deterministic signatures of causation, enabling the detection of weak and bidirectional causal links that linear models fail to resolve. Results demonstrate that CCM achieves higher specificity and fewer false positives on synthetic benchmarks, while maintaining robustness under observational noise and limited sample lengths. On Arctic data, CCM reveals significant causal interactions between sea ice extent and atmospheric variables like specific humidity, longwave radiation, and surface temperature with a $p$-value of $0.009$, supporting ice-albedo feedbacks and moisture-radiation couplings central to Arctic amplification. In contrast, stochastic approaches miss these nonlinear dependencies or infer spurious causal relations. This work establishes CCM as a robust causal inference tool for nonlinear climate dynamics and provides the first systematic benchmarking framework for method selection in climate research.</p></details> | <details><summary>In AC...</summary><p>In ACM Sigspatial Conference Workshop, 8 pages</p></details> |

| **[Clustering methods for Categorical Time Series and Sequences : A scoping review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07885v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: To provide an overview of clustering methods for categorical time series (CTS), a data structure commonly found in epidemiology, sociology, biology, and marketing, and to support method selection in regards to data characteristics. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, from inception up to November 2024 to identify articles that propose and evaluate clustering techniques for CTS. Methods were classified according to three major families -- distance-based, feature-based, and model-based -- and assessed on their ability to handle data challenges such as variable sequence length, multivariate data, continuous time, missing data, time-invariant covariates, and large data volumes. Results: Out of 14607 studies, we included 124 articles describing 129 methods, spanning domains such as artificial intelligence, social sciences, and epidemiology. Distance-based methods, particularly those using Optimal Matching, were most prevalent, with 56 methods. We identified 28 model-based methods, which demonstrated superior flexibility for handling complex data structures such as multivariate data, continuous time and time-invariant covariates. We also recorded 45 feature-based approaches, which were on average more scalable but less flexible. A searchable Web application was developed to facilitate method selection based on dataset characteristics ( https://cts-clustering-scoping-review-7sxqj3sameqvmwkvnzfynz.streamlit.app/ ) Discussion: While distance-based methods dominate, model-based approaches offer the richest modeling potential but are less scalable. Feature-based methods favor performance over flexibility, with limited support for complex data structures. Conclusion: This review highlights methodological diversity and gaps in CTS clustering. The proposed typology aims to guide researchers in selecting methods for their specific use cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal graph neural process for reconstruction, extrapolation, and classification of cardiac trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12953v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a probabilistic framework for modeling structured spatiotemporal dynamics from sparse observations, focusing on cardiac motion. Our approach integrates neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and neural processes into a unified model that captures uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure. We represent dynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent trajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context observations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over latent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and extrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic dynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto oscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK Biobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and disease classification capabilities. The model accurately reconstructs trajectories and extrapolates future cardiac cycles from a single observed cycle. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ACDC classification task (up to 99% accuracy), and detects atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank subjects with competitive performance (up to 67% accuracy). This work introduces a flexible approach for analyzing cardiac motion and offers a foundation for graph-based learning in structured biomedical spatiotemporal time-series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[FEWT: Improving Humanoid Robot Perception with Frequency-Enhanced Wavelet-based Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11109v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The embodied intelligence bridges the physical world and information space. As its typical physical embodiment, humanoid robots have shown great promise through robot learning algorithms in recent years. In this study, a hardware platform, including humanoid robot and exoskeleton-style teleoperation cabin, was developed to realize intuitive remote manipulation and efficient collection of anthropomorphic action data. To improve the perception representation of humanoid robot, an imitation learning framework, termed Frequency-Enhanced Wavelet-based Transformer (FEWT), was proposed, which consists of two primary modules: Frequency-Enhanced Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (FE-EMA) and Time-Series Discrete Wavelet Transform (TS-DWT). By combining multi-scale wavelet decomposition with the residual network, FE-EMA can dynamically fuse features from both cross-spatial and frequency-domain. This fusion is able to capture feature information across various scales effectively, thereby enhancing model robustness. Experimental performance demonstrates that FEWT improves the success rate of the state-of-the-art algorithm (Action Chunking with Transformers, ACT baseline) by up to 30% in simulation and by 6-12% in real-world.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeCluster with PCA is Equivalent to Subspace Identification of Linear Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12895v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>TimeCluster is a visual analytics technique for discovering structure in long multivariate time series by projecting overlapping windows of data into a low-dimensional space. We show that, when Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is chosen as the dimensionality reduction technique, this procedure is mathematically equivalent to classical linear subspace identification (block-Hankel matrix plus Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD)). In both approaches, the same low-dimensional linear subspace is extracted from the time series data. We first review the TimeCluster method and the theory of subspace system identification. Then we show that forming the sliding-window matrix of a time series yields a Hankel matrix, so applying PCA (via SVD) to this matrix recovers the same principal directions as subspace identification. Thus the cluster coordinates from TimeCluster coincide with the subspace identification methods. We present experiments on synthetic and real dynamical signals confirming that the two embeddings coincide. Finally, we explore and discuss future opportunities enabled by this equivalence, including forecasting from the identified state space, streaming/online extensions, incorporating and visualising external inputs and robust techniques for displaying underlying trends in corrupted data.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[A Novel Recurrent Neural Network Framework for Prediction and Treatment of Oncogenic Mutation Progression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12732v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant medical advancements, cancer remains the second leading cause of death, with over 600,000 deaths per year in the US. One emerging field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient, effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First, mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database. Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by mutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN predictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible treatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater than 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing played an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating that each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key driver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted gene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer. Overall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible treatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, work originally done in 2022/2023 and was awarded as one of the Regeneron Science Talent Search Finalists in 2022</p></details> |
| **[Shape-to-Scale InSAR Adaptive Filtering and Phase Linking under Complex Elliptical Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12700v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed scatterers in InSAR (DS-InSAR) processing are essential for retrieving surface deformation in areas lacking strong point targets. Conventional workflows typically involve selecting statistically homogeneous pixels based on amplitude similarity, followed by phase estimation under the complex circular Gaussian model. However, amplitude statistics primarily reflect the backscattering strength of surface targets and may not sufficiently capture differences in decorrelation behavior. For example, when distinct scatterers exhibit similar backscatter strength but differ in coherence, amplitude-based selection methods may fail to differentiate them. Moreover, CCG-based phase estimators may lack robustness and suffer performance degradation under non-Rayleigh amplitude fluctuations. Centered around scale-invariant second-order statistics, we propose ``Shape-to-Scale,'' a novel DS-InSAR framework. We first identify pixels that share a common angular scattering structure (``shape statistically homogeneous pixels'') with an angular consistency adaptive filter: a parametric selection method based on the complex angular central Gaussian distribution. Then, we introduce a complex generalized Gaussian-based phase estimation approach that is robust to potential non-Rayleigh scattering. Experiments on both simulated and SAR datasets show that the proposed framework improves coherence structure clustering and enhances phase estimation robustness. This work provides a unified and physically interpretable strategy for DS-InSAR processing and offers new insights for high-resolution SAR time series analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Intermediate Representations of Time Series Foundation Models for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12650v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in time series data is essential for the reliable operation of many real-world systems. Recently, time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However, existing methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs, computing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a task-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection approach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs, computing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations. Given a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and patch-token position that yield the most informative representation. TimeRep forms a reference collection of intermediate representations from the training data and applies a core-set strategy to reduce its size while maintaining distributional coverage. During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score for incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate representations and those of the collection. To address concept drift, TimeRep integrates an adaptation mechanism that, at inference time, augments the collection exclusively with non-redundant intermediate representations from incoming data. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, which contains 250 univariate time series. TimeRep consistently outperforms a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art baselines, including non-DL, DL, and foundation model-based methods.</p></details> | 10 pages,8 figures |

According to the results, the use of assertions that cause a kernel panic has slightly but not substantially decreased from the kernel's third to the sixth release series. At the same time, the use of softer assertion variants has increased; these do not cause a panic by default but instead produce warnings.

A cross-modal deep metric learning feature clustering model is constructed, composed of an input layer, a triplet selection layer, and a loss function computation layer. The squared Euclidean distances between cluster centers are calculated, and a stochastic gradient descent strategy is employed to optimize the model and classify different time series features. The inner product of principal component direction vectors is used as a metric for anomaly measurement. The von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is applied to describe the directional characteristics of time series data, and historical data is used to train and obtain evaluation parameters. By comparing the principal component direction vector of actual time series data with the threshold, anomaly detection is performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately classifies time series data with different attributes, exhibits high sensitivity to anomalies, and achieves high detection accuracy, fast detection speed, and strong robustness.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion models have shown to be effective to generate realistic and synthetic data, and correct corrupted samples through imputation. In this context, this paper focuses on generating synthetic yet realistic samples of automotive time series data. We show that denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can effectively solve this task by applying them to a challenging vehicle CAN-dataset with long-term data and a limited number of samples. Therefore, we propose a hybrid generative approach that combines autoregressive and non-autoregressive techniques. We evaluate our approach with two recently proposed DDPM architectures for time series generation, for which we propose several improvements. To evaluate the generated samples, we propose three metrics that quantify physical correctness and test track adherence. Our best model is able to outperform even the training data in terms of physical correctness, while showing plausible driving behavior. Finally, we use our best model to successfully impute physically implausible regions in the training data, thereby improving the data quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Paper has been accepted at ITSC 2025</p></details> |

These systems have the potential to produce large volumes of information in the form of multivariate time-series data, which could be used for enhanced real-time monitoring and control. In this context, the development of remote autonomous or semi-autonomous control systems for reactor operation has gained significant interest. A critical first step toward such systems is an accurate diagnostics module capable of detecting and localizing anomalies within the reactor system. Recent studies have proposed various ML and DL approaches for anomaly detection in the nuclear domain. Despite promising results, key challenges remain, including limited to no explainability, lack of access to real-world data, and scarcity of abnormal events, which impedes benchmarking and characterization. Most existing studies treat these methods as black boxes, while recent work highlights the need for greater interpretability of ML/DL outputs in safety-critical domains. Here, we propose an unsupervised methodology based on an LSTM autoencoder with a dual attention mechanism for characterization of abnormal events in a real-world reactor radiation area monitoring system. The framework includes not only detection but also localization of the event and was evaluated using real-world datasets of increasing complexity from the PUR-1 research reactor. The attention mechanisms operate in both the feature and temporal dimensions, where the feature attention assigns weights to radiation sensors exhibiting abnormal patterns, while time attention highlights the specific timesteps where irregularities occur, thus enabling localization. By combining the results, the framework can identify both the affected sensors and the duration of each anomaly within a single unified network.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Relational Priming Improves Transformer in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12196v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard attention mechanisms in transformers employ static token representations that remain unchanged across all pair-wise computations in each layer. This limits their representational alignment with the potentially diverse relational dynamics of each token-pair interaction. While they excel in domains with relatively homogeneous relationships, standard attention's static relational learning struggles to capture the diverse, heterogeneous inter-channel dependencies of multivariate time series (MTS) data--where different channel-pair interactions within a single system may be governed by entirely different physical laws or temporal dynamics. To better align the attention mechanism for such domain phenomena, we propose attention with dynamic relational priming (prime attention). Unlike standard attention where each token presents an identical representation across all of its pair-wise interactions, prime attention tailors each token dynamically (or per interaction) through learnable modulations to best capture the unique relational dynamics of each token pair, optimizing each pair-wise interaction for that specific relationship. This representational plasticity of prime attention enables effective extraction of relationship-specific information in MTS while maintaining the same asymptotic computational complexity as standard attention. Our results demonstrate that prime attention consistently outperforms standard attention across benchmarks, achieving up to 6.5\% improvement in forecasting accuracy. In addition, we find that prime attention achieves comparable or superior performance using up to 40\% less sequence length compared to standard attention, further demonstrating its superior relational modeling capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Time-Series Foundation Model by Universal Delay Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12080v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces Universal Delay Embedding (UDE), a pretrained foundation model designed to revolutionize time-series forecasting through principled integration of delay embedding representation and Koopman operator prediction. Leveraging Takens' embedding theorem, UDE as a dynamical representation of observed data constructs two-dimensional subspace patches from Hankel matrices, theoretically preserving dynamical and topological properties of underlying dynamical systems. Such patches are viewed as images, which can be efficiently processed by exploiting advanced deep learning technologies. Computationally, these patches further serve as tokens for learning a self-attention encoder, thus enabling accurate prediction of nonlinear time-series by a finite-dimensional Koopman operator in a linear manner in a latent space. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks and real-world climate datasets demonstrate over 20% average reduction in mean squared error versus state-of-the-art foundation models, alongside superior generalization in fine-tuning scenarios. In particular, the learned dynamical representations and Koopman operator prediction forms from the patches exhibit exceptional interpretability, with consistent identification of topologically informative subspaces and robust encoding of domain-invariant dynamics, establishing UDE as a scalable, interpretable framework for universal time-series modeling and forecasting with broad scientific and industrial applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Fetal Pose Estimation across Gestational Ages via Cross-Population Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12062v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fetal motion is a critical indicator of neurological development and intrauterine health, yet its quantification remains challenging, particularly at earlier gestational ages (GA). Current methods track fetal motion by predicting the location of annotated landmarks on 3D echo planar imaging (EPI) time-series, primarily in third-trimester fetuses. The predicted landmarks enable simplification of the fetal body for downstream analysis. While these methods perform well within their training age distribution, they consistently fail to generalize to early GAs due to significant anatomical changes in both mother and fetus across gestation, as well as the difficulty of obtaining annotated early GA EPI data. In this work, we develop a cross-population data augmentation framework that enables pose estimation models to robustly generalize to younger GA clinical cohorts using only annotated images from older GA cohorts. Specifically, we introduce a fetal-specific augmentation strategy that simulates the distinct intrauterine environment and fetal positioning of early GAs. Our experiments find that cross-population augmentation yields reduced variability and significant improvements across both older GA and challenging early GA cases. By enabling more reliable pose estimation across gestation, our work potentially facilitates early clinical detection and intervention in challenging 4D fetal imaging settings.

Traditional tomographic methods are often data-intensive and struggle with scalability.

| **[Wavelet-SARIMA-Transformer: A Hybrid Model for Rainfall Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11903v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study develops and evaluates a novel hybridWavelet SARIMA Transformer, WST framework to forecast using monthly rainfall across five meteorological subdivisions of Northeast India over the 1971 to 2023 period. The approach employs the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform, MODWT with four wavelet families such as, Haar, Daubechies, Symlet, Coiflet etc. to achieve shift invariant, multiresolution decomposition of the rainfall series. Linear and seasonal components are modeled using Seasonal ARIMA, SARIMA, while nonlinear components are modeled by a Transformer network, and forecasts are reconstructed via inverse MODWT. Comprehensive validation using an 80 is to 20 train test split and multiple performance indices such as, RMSE, MAE, SMAPE, Willmotts d, Skill Score, Percent Bias, Explained Variance, and Legates McCabes E1 demonstrates the superiority of the Haar-based hybrid model, WHST. Across all subdivisions, WHST consistently achieved lower forecast errors, stronger agreement with observed rainfall, and unbiased predictions compared with stand alone SARIMA, stand-alone Transformer, and two-stage wavelet hybrids. Residual adequacy was confirmed through the Ljung Box test, while Taylor diagrams provided an integrated assessment of correlation, variance fidelity, and RMSE, further reinforcing the robustness of the proposed approach. The results highlight the effectiveness of integrating multiresolution signal decomposition with complementary linear and deep learning models for hydroclimatic forecasting. Beyond rainfall, the proposed WST framework offers a scalable methodology for forecasting complex environmental time series, with direct implications for flood risk management, water resources planning, and climate adaptation strategies in data-sparse and climate-sensitive regions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Path Signature Framework for Detecting Creative Fatigue in Digital Advertising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09758v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel framework for detecting advertising creative fatigue using path signature analysis, a geometric approach from rough path theory not previously applied in marketing. Creative fatigue - the decline in advertising effectiveness over time - poses a major risk to digital media spend. Our method transforms performance time-series into geometric paths, extracting high-dimensional signatures to capture complex dynamics: volatility shifts, trend reversals, and non-linear decay. Unlike traditional statistical methods, this approach detects subtle, multi-scale changes. We validate the framework using synthetic datasets replicating documented fatigue patterns from marketing literature. Results show superior early detection, enabling actionable insights before significant budget loss. A novel financial impact model quantifies opportunity costs from delayed detection, while computational analysis confirms linear scalability for real-time monitoring of large creative portfolios.</p></details> | version 2 |
| **[TemporalFED: Detecting Cyberattacks in Industrial Time-Series Data Using Decentralized Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03554v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industry 4.0 has brought numerous advantages, such as increasing productivity through automation. However, it also presents major cybersecurity issues such as cyberattacks affecting industrial processes. Federated Learning (FL) combined with time-series analysis is a promising cyberattack detection mechanism proposed in the literature. However, the fact of having a single point of failure and network bottleneck are critical challenges that need to be tackled. Thus, this article explores the benefits of the Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) in terms of cyberattack detection and resource consumption. The work presents TemporalFED, a software module for detecting anomalies in industrial environments using FL paradigms and time series. TemporalFED incorporates three components: Time Series Conversion, Feature Engineering, and Time Series Stationary Conversion. To evaluate TemporalFED, it was deployed on Fedstellar, a DFL framework. Then, a pool of experiments measured the detection performance and resource consumption in a chemical gas industrial environment with different time-series configurations, FL paradigms, and topologies. The results showcase the superiority of the configuration utilizing DFL and Semi-Decentralized Federated Learning (SDFL) paradigms, along with a fully connected topology, which achieved the best performance in anomaly detection. Regarding resource consumption, the configuration without feature engineering employed less bandwidth, CPU, and RAM than other configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology Structure Optimization of Reservoirs Using GLMY Homology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11612v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir is an efficient network for time series processing. It is well known that network structure is one of the determinants of its performance. However, the topology structure of reservoirs, as well as their performance, is hard to analyzed, due to the lack of suitable mathematical tools. In this paper, we study the topology structure of reservoirs using persistent GLMY homology theory, and develop a method to improve its performance. Specifically, it is found that the reservoir performance is closely related to the one-dimensional GLMY homology groups. Then, we develop a reservoir structure optimization method by modifying the minimal representative cycles of one-dimensional GLMY homology groups. Finally, by experiments, it is validated that the performance of reservoirs is jointly influenced by the reservoir structure and the periodicity of the dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Reasoning and Agentic Systems in Time Series with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11575v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series reasoning treats time as a first-class axis and incorporates intermediate evidence directly into the answer. This survey defines the problem and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling, tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and deployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey). Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty, grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable evidence and credible outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |

Exposure to air pollutants such as PM$_{10}$ $\mu$m, NO$_2$, and SO$_2$ has been associated with the worsening of these diseases, especially in urban areas. This study evaluated the association between the daily concentration of these pollutants and daily hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular diseases in S\~ao Paulo (2010-2019), using generalized additive models with a lag of 0 to 4 days. Two approaches for choosing the degrees of freedom in temporal smoothing were compared: based on pollutant prediction and based on outcome prediction (hospitalizations). Data were obtained from official government databases. The modeling used the quasi-Poisson family in R software (v. 4.4.0). Models with exposure-based smoothing generated more consistent estimates. For PM10{\mu}m, the cumulative risk estimate for exposure was 1.08%, while for hospitalization, it was 1.20%. For NO$_2$, the estimated risk was 1.47% (exposure) versus 1.33% (hospitalization). For SO$_2$, a striking difference was observed: 7.66% (exposure) versus 14.31% (hospitalization). The significant lags were on days 0, 1, and 2. The results show that smoothing based on outcome prediction can generate bias, masking the true effect of pollutants. The appropriate choice of df in the smoothing function is crucial. Smoothing by the pollutant series was more robust and accurate, contributing to methodological improvements in time-series studies and reinforcing the importance of public policies for pollution control.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages with 4 figures</p></details> |

Traditional time-series models lack explainability, while LLMs face challenges in turning natural-language analysis into disciplined, executable trades. Although reasoning LLMs have advanced in step-by-step planning and verification, their application to risk-sensitive financial decisions is underexplored. We present Trading-R1, a financially-aware model that incorporates strategic thinking and planning for comprehensive thesis composition, facts-grounded analysis, and volatility-adjusted decision making. Trading-R1 aligns reasoning with trading principles through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with a three-stage easy-to-hard curriculum. Training uses Tauric-TR1-DB, a 100k-sample corpus spanning 18 months, 14 equities, and five heterogeneous financial data sources. Evaluated on six major equities and ETFs, Trading-R1 demonstrates improved risk-adjusted returns and lower drawdowns compared to both open-source and proprietary instruction-following models as well as reasoning models. The system generates structured, evidence-based investment theses that support disciplined and interpretable trading decisions. Trading-R1 Terminal will be released at https://github.com/TauricResearch/Trading-R1.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tauri...</summary><p>Tauric Research: https://github.com/TauricResearch</p></details> |
| **[Improved Classification of Nitrogen Stress Severity in Plants Under Combined Stress Conditions Using Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06625v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses, both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment. Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral, and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data, document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low, medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies. We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop management and improved plant health.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 7 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Next-Generation Reservoir Computing for Dynamical Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11338v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple and scalable implementation of next-generation reservoir computing for modeling dynamical systems from time series data. Our approach uses a pseudorandom nonlinear projection of time-delay embedded input, allowing an arbitrary dimension of the feature space, thus providing a flexible alternative to the polynomial-based projections used in previous next-generation reservoir computing variants. We apply the method to benchmark tasks -- including attractor reconstruction and bifurcation diagram estimation -- using only partial and noisy observations. We also include an exploratory example of estimating asymptotic oscillation phases. The models remain stable over long rollouts and generalize beyond training data. This framework enables the precise control of system state and is well suited for surrogate modeling and digital twin applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Parameter estimation for fractional autoregressive process with periodic structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20736v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a new periodic fractional autoregressive process (PFAR) driven by fractional Gaussian noise (fGn) to model time series of precipitation evapotranspiration. Compared with the similar model in [\emph{Water Resources Research}, \textbf{20} (1984) 1898--1908], the new model incorporates a periodic structure via specialized varying coefficients and captures long memory and rough voltality through fGn for $0<H<1$, rather than via fractional differencing. In this work, Generalized Least Squares Estimation (GLSE) and the GPH method are employed to construct an initial estimator for the joint estimation of model parameters. A One-Step procedure is then used to obtain a more asymptotically efficient estimator. The paper proves that both estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal, and their performance is demonstrated via Monte Carlo simulations with finite-size samples. Simulation studies suggest that, while both estimation methods can accurately estimate the model parameters, the One-Step estimator outperforms the initial estimator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rumor Detection by Multi-task Suffix Learning based on Time-series Dual Sentiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14383v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread dissemination of rumors on social media has a significant impact on people's lives, potentially leading to public panic and fear. Rumors often evoke specific sentiments, resonating with readers and prompting sharing. To effectively detect and track rumors, it is essential to observe the fine-grained sentiments of both source and response message pairs as the rumor evolves over time. However, current rumor detection methods fail to account for this aspect. In this paper, we propose MSuf, the first multi-task suffix learning framework for rumor detection and tracking using time series dual (coupled) sentiments. MSuf includes three modules: (1) an LLM to extract sentiment intensity features and sort them chronologically; (2) a module that fuses the sorted sentiment features with their source text word embeddings to obtain an aligned embedding; (3) two hard prompts are combined with the aligned vector to perform rumor detection and sentiment analysis using one frozen LLM. MSuf effectively enhances the performance of LLMs for rumor detection with only minimal parameter fine-tuning. Evaluating MSuf on four rumor detection benchmarks, we find significant improvements compared to other emotion-based methods.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Learning Chaotic Dynamics with Neuromorphic Network Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10773v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a physical neuromorphic network device can be feasibly optimised for learning complex dynamical systems using only external control parameters.</p></details> | 42 pages, 24 figures |
| **[Maximum diversity, weighting and invariants of time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11146v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnitude, obtained as a special case of Euler characteristic of enriched category, represents a sense of the size of metric spaces and is related to classical notions such as cardinality, dimension, and volume. While the studies have explained the meaning of magnitude from various perspectives, continuity also gives a valuable view of magnitude. Based on established results about continuity of magnitude and maximum diversity, this article focuses on continuity of weighting, a distribution whose totality is magnitude, and its variation corresponding to maximum diversity. Meanwhile, recent studies also illuminated the connection between magnitude and data analysis by applying magnitude theory to point clouds representing the data or the set of model parameters. This article will also provide an application for time series analysis by introducing a new kind of invariants of periodic time series, where the invariance follows directly from the continuity results. As a use-case, a simple machine learning experiment is conducted with real-world data, in which the suggested invariants improved the performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-Scale Curve Time Series with Common Stochastic Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11060v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies high-dimensional curve time series with common stochastic trends. A dual functional factor model structure is adopted with a high-dimensional factor model for the observed curve time series and a low-dimensional factor model for the latent curves with common trends. A functional PCA technique is applied to estimate the common stochastic trends and functional factor loadings. Under some regularity conditions we derive the mean square convergence and limit distribution theory for the developed estimates, allowing the dimension and sample size to jointly diverge to infinity. We propose an easy-to-implement criterion to consistently select the number of common stochastic trends and further discuss model estimation when the nonstationary factors are cointegrated. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations and two empirical applications to large-scale temperature curves in Australia and log-price curves of S&P 500 stocks are conducted, showing finite-sample performance and providing practical implementations of the new methodology.</p></details> |  |

Edge computing facilitates aggregation at edge and reduces latency. To deal with model poisoning attacks, model-based outlier detection mechanisms may not operate efficiently with hetereogenous models or in recognition of complex attacks. This paper fosters the defense line against model poisoning attack by exploiting device-level traffic analysis to anticipate the reliability of participants. FL is empowered with a topology mutation strategy, as a Moving Target Defence (MTD) strategy to dynamically change the participants in learning. Based on the adoption of recurrent neural networks for time-series analysis of traffic and a 6G wireless model, optimization framework for MTD strategy is given. A deep reinforcement mechanism is provided to optimize topology mutation in adaption with the anticipated Byzantine status of devices and the communication channel capabilities at devices. For a DDoS attack detection application and under Botnet attack at devices level, results illustrate acceptable malicious models exclusion and improvement in recognition time and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Branched Broomrape Detection in Tomato Farms Using Satellite Imagery and Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10804v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa (L.) Pomel) is a chlorophyll-deficient parasitic plant that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from the host, with reported yield losses up to 80 percent. Its mostly subterranean life cycle and prolific seed production (more than 200,000 seeds per plant, viable for up to 20 years) make early detection essential. We present an end-to-end pipeline that uses Sentinel-2 imagery and time-series analysis to identify broomrape-infested tomato fields in California. Regions of interest were defined from farmer-reported infestations, and images with less than 10 percent cloud cover were retained. We processed 12 spectral bands and sun-sensor geometry, computed 20 vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, NDMI), and derived five plant traits (Leaf Area Index, Leaf Chlorophyll Content, Canopy Chlorophyll Content, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, and Fractional Vegetation Cover) using a neural network calibrated with ground-truth and synthetic data. Trends in Canopy Chlorophyll Content delineated transplanting-to-harvest periods, and phenology was aligned using growing degree days. Vegetation pixels were segmented and used to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network on 18,874 pixels across 48 growing-degree-day time points. The model achieved 88 percent training accuracy and 87 percent test accuracy, with precision 0.86, recall 0.92, and F1 0.89. Permutation feature importance ranked NDMI, Canopy Chlorophyll Content, FAPAR, and a chlorophyll red-edge index as most informative, consistent with the physiological effects of infestation. Results show the promise of satellite-driven time-series modeling for scalable detection of parasitic stress in tomato farms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author-accepted version.

Explainable Multimodal Learning for Multi-Class Default Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10802v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, China's bond market has seen a surge in defaults amid regulatory reforms and macroeconomic volatility. Traditional machine learning models struggle to capture financial data's irregularity and temporal dependencies, while most deep learning models lack interpretability-critical for financial decision-making. To tackle these issues, we propose EMDLOT (Explainable Multimodal Deep Learning for Time-series), a novel framework for multi-class bond default prediction. EMDLOT integrates numerical time-series (financial/macroeconomic indicators) and unstructured textual data (bond prospectuses), uses Time-Aware LSTM to handle irregular sequences, and adopts soft clustering and multi-level attention to boost interpretability. Experiments on 1994 Chinese firms (2015-2024) show EMDLOT outperforms traditional (e.g., XGBoost) and deep learning (e.g., LSTM) benchmarks in recall, F1-score, and mAP, especially in identifying default/extended firms. Ablation studies validate each component's value, and attention analyses reveal economically intuitive default drivers. This work provides a practical tool and a trustworthy framework for transparent financial risk modeling.</p></details> |  |

We show that large language models (LLMs) can be used for late fusion for activity classification from audio and motion time series data. We curated a subset of data for diverse activity recognition across contexts (e.g., household activities, sports) from the Ego4D dataset. Evaluated LLMs achieved 12-class zero- and one-shot classification F1-scores significantly above chance, with no task-specific training. Zero-shot classification via LLM-based fusion from modality-specific models can enable multimodal temporal applications where there is limited aligned training data for learning a shared embedding space. Additionally, LLM-based fusion can enable model deploying without requiring additional memory and computation for targeted application-specific multimodal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |
| **[Continuum Attention for Neural Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06486v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers, and the attention mechanism in particular, have become ubiquitous in machine learning. Their success in modeling nonlocal, long-range correlations has led to their widespread adoption in natural language processing, computer vision, and time series problems. Neural operators, which map spaces of functions into spaces of functions, are necessarily both nonlinear and nonlocal if they are universal; it is thus natural to ask whether the attention mechanism can be used in the design of neural operators. Motivated by this, we study transformers in the function space setting. We formulate attention as a map between infinite dimensional function spaces and prove that the attention mechanism as implemented in practice is a Monte Carlo or finite difference approximation of this operator. The function space formulation allows for the design of transformer neural operators, a class of architectures designed to learn mappings between function spaces. In this paper, we state and prove the first universal approximation result for transformer neural operators, using only a slight modification of the architecture implemented in practice. The prohibitive cost of applying the attention operator to functions defined on multi-dimensional domains leads to the need for more efficient attention-based architectures. For this reason we also introduce a function space generalization of the patching strategy from computer vision, and introduce a class of associated neural operators. Numerical results, on an array of operator learning problems, demonstrate the promise of our approaches to function space formulations of attention and their use in neural operators.</p></details> |  |

However, when such models are applied directly to under-reported case counts, their mechanistic interpretation can break down. We establish new theoretical results quantifying the consequences of ignoring under-reporting in these models. To address this issue, reported cases are often modelled as a binomially thinned version of an underlying count process, but such models are difficult to fit because the unobserved true counts are serially correlated and integer-valued. We develop a new statistical framework for under-reported infectious-disease data that uses a normal-normal approximation to a broad class of thinned count autoregressions and then accurately maps this continuous process back to the integers. Through simulations and applications to rotavirus incidence in a German state and Covid-19 incidence in English conurbations, we demonstrate that our approach both retains the mechanistic appeal of thinned autoregressions and substantially simplifies inference.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning architecture in which input data are first processed through a customized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies aligned with drilling operational cycles, and the resulting features are subsequently refined by an Enhanced Transformer encoder with drilling-specific positional encodings and real-time optimization. Concurrently, the same input is directed to a Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) block that enables efficient cross-feature modeling of static and categorical attributes such as lithology indices and mud properties. The outputs from the enhanced Transformer and TS-Mixer are concatenated, after which an adaptive attention selectively emphasizes the most informative feature representations for accurate ROP prediction. The proposed framework fuses sequential memory, static feature interactions, global contextual learning, and dynamic feature weighting, providing a comprehensive solution to the heterogeneous and event-driven nature of drilling dynamics. Evaluation on a real-world drilling dataset demonstrates benchmark-leading performance, achieving an Rsqaure of 0.9988 and a MAPE of 1.447%, significantly surpassing standalone and hybrid baselines. Model interpretability is achieved through SHAP and LIME, and comparisons between actual and predicted curves, along with bias checks, confirm the accuracy and fairness of the model across various scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables dependable real-time ROP prediction, supporting the development of intelligent, cost-effective drilling optimization systems with significant operational benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 Pa...</summary><p>35 Pages, 19 Figures, 9 Tables</p></details> |

The proposed block, inspired by the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, consists of two convolutional components: one for capturing the trend (autoregression) and the other for refining local variations (moving average). Unlike conventional ARIMA, which requires iterative multi-step forecasting, the block directly performs multi-step forecasting, making it easily extendable to multivariate settings. Experiments on nine widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method ARMA achieves competitive accuracy, particularly on datasets exhibiting strong trend variations, while maintaining architectural simplicity. Furthermore, analysis shows that the block inherently encodes absolute positional information, suggesting its potential as a lightweight replacement for positional embeddings in sequential models.</p></details> |  |

While numerous efforts have substantially advanced the large-scale modeling of hazard and exposure through Earth observation and data-driven methods, progress remains limited in modeling another equally important yet challenging element of the risk equation: physical vulnerability. To address this gap, we introduce Graph Categorical Structured Variational Autoencoder (GraphCSVAE), a novel probabilistic data-driven framework for modeling physical vulnerability by integrating deep learning, graph representation, and categorical probabilistic inference, using time-series satellite-derived datasets and prior expert belief systems. We introduce a weakly supervised first-order transition matrix that reflects the changes in the spatiotemporal distribution of physical vulnerability in two disaster-stricken and socioeconomically disadvantaged areas: (1) the cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community in Bangladesh and (2) the mudslide-affected city of Freetown in Sierra Leone. Our work reveals post-disaster regional dynamics in physical vulnerability, offering valuable insights into localized spatiotemporal auditing and sustainable strategies for post-disaster risk reduction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted full paper at the 8th International Disaster and Risk Conference, IDRC 2025 | Keywords: weakly supervised, graph deep learning, categorical distribution, physical vulnerability, remote sensing, spatiotemporal disaster risk, transition matrix | The data and code are respectively available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16656471 and https://github.com/riskaudit/GraphCSVAE</p></details> |

This study first quantifies the periodicity in complex human mobility data as a sparse identification of dominant positive auto-correlations in time series autoregression and then discovers periodic patterns. We apply the framework to large-scale metro passenger flow data in Hangzhou, China and multi-modal mobility data in New York City and Chicago, USA, revealing the interpretable weekly periodicity across different spatial locations over past several years. The analysis of ridesharing data from 2019 to 2024 demonstrates the disruptive impact of the pandemic on mobility regularity and the subsequent recovery trends. In 2024, the periodic mobility patterns of ridesharing, taxi, subway, and bikesharing in Manhattan uncover the regularity and variability of these travel modes. Our findings highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning to discover spatiotemporal mobility patterns and offer a valuable tool for understanding urban systems.</p></details> |  |

Reservoir computing (RC) has drawn attention as an RNN framework due to its fixed network that does not require training, making it an attractive platform for hardware based machine learning. We establish an explicit correspondence between the well-established mathematical RC implementations of Echo State Networks and Band-pass Networks with Leaky Integrator nodes on the one hand and a physical circuit containing iontronic simple volatile memristors on the other. These aqueous iontronic devices employ ion transport through water as signal carriers, and feature a voltage-dependent (memory) conductance. The activation function and the dynamics of the Leaky Integrator nodes naturally materialise as the (dynamic) conductance properties of iontronic memristors, while a simple fixed local current-to-voltage update rule at the memristor terminals facilitates the relevant matrix coupling between nodes. We process various time series, including pressure data from simulated airways during breathing that can be directly fed into the network due to the intrinsic responsiveness of iontronic devices to applied pressures. We accomplish this by employing established physical equations of motion of iontronic memristors for the internal dynamics of the circuit.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAESTRO: Multi-modal Adaptive Estimation for Temporal Respiratory Disease Outbreak](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08578v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public health decision-making. This paper presents MAESTRO (Multi-modal Adaptive Estimation for Temporal Respiratory Disease Outbreak), a novel, unified framework that synergistically integrates advanced spectro-temporal modeling with multi-modal data fusion, including surveillance, web search trends, and meteorological data. By adaptively weighting heterogeneous data sources and decomposing complex time series patterns, the model achieves robust and accurate forecasts. Evaluated on over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period), MAESTRO demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior model fit with an R-square of 0.956. Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of its multi-modal and spectro-temporal components. The modular and reproducible pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to other regions and pathogens, presenting a powerful tool for epidemiological forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multivariate Long-term Time Series Forecasting with Fourier Neural Filter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09174v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate long-term time series forecasting has been suffering from the challenge of capturing both temporal dependencies within variables and spatial correlations across variables simultaneously. Current approaches predominantly repurpose backbones from natural language processing or computer vision (e.g., Transformers), which fail to adequately address the unique properties of time series (e.g., periodicity). The research community lacks a dedicated backbone with temporal-specific inductive biases, instead relying on domain-agnostic backbones supplemented with auxiliary techniques (e.g., signal decomposition). We introduce FNF as the backbone and DBD as the architecture to provide excellent learning capabilities and optimal learning pathways for spatio-temporal modeling, respectively. Our theoretical analysis proves that FNF unifies local time-domain and global frequency-domain information processing within a single backbone that extends naturally to spatial modeling, while information bottleneck theory demonstrates that DBD provides superior gradient flow and representation capacity compared to existing unified or sequential architectures. Our empirical evaluation across 11 public benchmark datasets spanning five domains (energy, meteorology, transportation, environment, and nature) confirms state-of-the-art performance with consistent hyperparameter settings. Notably, our approach achieves these results without any auxiliary techniques, suggesting that properly designed neural architectures can capture the inherent properties of time series, potentially transforming time series modeling in scientific and industrial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Coding Representation of 2-way Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10033v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse dictionary coding represents signals as linear combinations of a few dictionary atoms. It has been applied to images, time series, graph signals and multi-way spatio-temporal data by jointly employing temporal and spatial dictionaries. Data-agnostic analytical dictionaries, such as the discrete Fourier transform, wavelets and graph Fourier, have seen wide adoption due to efficient implementations and good practical performance. On the other hand, dictionaries learned from data offer sparser and more accurate solutions but require learning of both the dictionaries and the coding coefficients. This becomes especially challenging for multi-dictionary scenarios since encoding coefficients correspond to all atom combinations from the dictionaries. To address this challenge, we propose a low-rank coding model for 2-dictionary scenarios and study its data complexity. Namely, we establish a bound on the number of samples needed to learn dictionaries that generalize to unseen samples from the same distribution. We propose a convex relaxation solution, called AODL, whose exact solution we show also solves the original problem. We then solve this relaxation via alternating optimization between the sparse coding matrices and the learned dictionaries, which we prove to be convergent. We demonstrate its quality for data reconstruction and missing value imputation in both synthetic and real-world datasets. For a fixed reconstruction quality, AODL learns up to 90\% sparser solutions compared to non-low-rank and analytical (fixed) dictionary baselines. In addition, the learned dictionaries reveal interpretable insights into patterns present within the samples used for training.</p></details> |  |

Accurate radiation dose estimation tailored to individual patients is crucial. Deep learning, particularly with pre-therapy imaging, holds promise for personalizing TRT doses. However, current methods require large time series of SPECT imaging, which is hardly achievable in routine clinical practice, and thus raises issues of data availability. Our objective is to develop a semi-supervised learning (SSL) solution to personalize dosimetry using pre-therapy images. The aim is to develop an approach that achieves accurate results when PET/CT images are available, but are associated with only a few post-therapy dosimetry data provided by SPECT images. In this work, we introduce an SSL method using a pseudo-label generation approach for regression tasks inspired by the FixMatch framework. The feasibility of the proposed solution was preliminarily evaluated through an in-silico study using synthetic data and Monte Carlo simulation. Experimental results for organ dose prediction yielded promising outcomes, showing that the use of pseudo-labeled data provides better accuracy compared to using only labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

| **[Out-of-Sight Trajectories: Tracking, Fusion, and Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15219v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous systems, playing a key role in autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual reality. Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free observational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight objects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera coverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised trajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable prediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present advancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the noise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data. Building on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight Trajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending its applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual reality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera calibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of visual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an unsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory denoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines. Additionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such as Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task, providing a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative to integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor trajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances.

However, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) are based on supervised deep learning - which leads to challenges when the distribution of trajectories changes due to such a shock. We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to integrate into our movement trajectory platform. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent SOTA models where we show highly accurate error detection, the ability to improve accuracy with a changing test distribution, and accuracy improvement for the base use case in addition to a suite of theoretical properties that informed algorithm development. Specifically, we show an F1 scores for predicting errors of up to 0.984, significant performance increase for out-of distribution accuracy (8.51% improvement over SOTA for zero-shot accuracy), and accuracy improvement over the SOTA model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at 4th International Workshop on Spatio-Temporal Reasoning and Learning (STRL 2025) at the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Movable-Antenna Trajectory Optimization for Wireless Sensing: CRB Scaling Laws over Time and Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14905v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a new wireless sensing system utilizing a movable antenna (MA) that continuously moves and receives sensing signals to enhance sensing performance over the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) sensing. We show that the angle estimation performance is fundamentally determined by the MA trajectory, and derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the mean square error (MSE) for angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation as a function of the trajectory for both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) antenna movement. For the 1D case, a globally optimal trajectory that minimizes the CRB is derived in closed form. Notably, the resulting CRB decreases cubically with sensing time in the time-constrained regime, whereas it decreases linearly with sensing time and quadratically with the movement line segment's length in the space-constrained regime. For the 2D case, we aim to achieve the minimum of maximum (min-max) CRBs of estimation MSE for the two AoAs with respect to the horizontal and vertical axes. To this end, we design an efficient alternating optimization algorithm that iteratively updates the MA's horizontal or vertical coordinates with the other being fixed, yielding a locally optimal trajectory. Numerical results show that the proposed 1D/2D MA-based sensing schemes significantly reduce both the CRB and actual AoA estimation MSE compared to conventional FPA-based sensing with uniform linear/planar arrays (ULAs/UPAs) as well as various benchmark MA trajectories. Moreover, it is revealed that the steering vectors of our designed 1D/2D MA trajectories have low correlation in the angular domain, thereby effectively increasing the angular resolution for achieving higher AoA estimation accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust and Secure Computation Offloading and Trajectory Optimization for Multi-UAV MEC Against Aerial Eavesdropper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14883v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based multi-access edge computing (MEC) appears as a popular paradigm to reduce task processing latency. However, the secure offloading is an important issue when occurring aerial eavesdropping. Besides, the potential uncertainties in practical applications and flexible trajectory optimizations of UAVs pose formidable challenges for realizing robust offloading. In this paper, we consider the aerial secure MEC network including ground users, service unmanned aerial vehicles (S-UAVs) integrated with edge servers, and malicious UAVs overhearing transmission links. To deal with the task computation complexities, which are characterized as uncertainties, a robust problem is formulated with chance constraints. The energy cost is minimized by optimizing the connections, trajectories of S-UAVs and offloading ratios. Then, the proposed non-linear problem is tackled via the distributionally robust optimization and conditional value-at-risk mechanism, which is further transformed into the second order cone programming forms. Moreover, we decouple the reformulated problem and design the successive convex approximation for S-UAV trajectories. The global algorithm is designed to solve the sub-problems in a block coordinate decent manner. Finally, extensive simulations and numerical analyses are conducted to verify the robustness of the proposed algorithms, with just 2\% more energy cost compared with the ideal circumstance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Representation Learning of Phenotype Trajectories for pCR Prediction in Breast Cancer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14872v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective therapy decisions require models that predict the individual response to treatment. This is challenging since the progression of disease and response to treatment vary substantially across patients. Here, we propose to learn a representation of the early dynamics of treatment response from imaging data to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The longitudinal change in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of the breast forms trajectories in the latent space, serving as basis for prediction of successful response. The multi-task model represents appearance, fosters temporal continuity and accounts for the comparably high heterogeneity in the non-responder cohort.In experiments on the publicly available ISPY-2 dataset, a linear classifier in the latent trajectory space achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.761 using only pre-treatment data (T0), 0.811 using early response (T0 + T1), and 0.861 using four imaging time points (T0 -> T3). The code will be made available upon paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[STEP: Structured Training and Evaluation Platform for benchmarking trajectory prediction models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14801v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While trajectory prediction plays a critical role in enabling safe and effective path-planning in automated vehicles, standardized practices for evaluating such models remain underdeveloped. Recent efforts have aimed to unify dataset formats and model interfaces for easier comparisons, yet existing frameworks often fall short in supporting heterogeneous traffic scenarios, joint prediction models, or user documentation. In this work, we introduce STEP -- a new benchmarking framework that addresses these limitations by providing a unified interface for multiple datasets, enforcing consistent training and evaluation conditions, and supporting a wide range of prediction models. We demonstrate the capabilities of STEP in a number of experiments which reveal 1) the limitations of widely-used testing procedures, 2) the importance of joint modeling of agents for better predictions of interactions, and 3) the vulnerability of current state-of-the-art models against both distribution shifts and targeted attacks by adversarial agents. With STEP, we aim to shift the focus from the ``leaderboard'' approach to deeper insights about model behavior and generalization in complex multi-agent settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Reference Trajectories in Agile Drone Racing: A Unified Reference-Free Model-Based Controller via MPPI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14726v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While model-based controllers have demonstrated remarkable performance in autonomous drone racing, their performance is often constrained by the reliance on pre-computed reference trajectories. Conventional approaches, such as trajectory tracking, demand a dynamically feasible, full-state reference, whereas contouring control relaxes this requirement to a geometric path but still necessitates a reference. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have revealed that many model-based controllers optimize surrogate objectives, such as trajectory tracking, rather than the primary racing goal of directly maximizing progress through gates. Inspired by these findings, this work introduces a reference-free method for time-optimal racing by incorporating this gate progress objective, derived from RL reward shaping, directly into the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) formulation. The sampling-based nature of MPPI makes it uniquely capable of optimizing the discontinuous and non-differentiable objective in real-time. We also establish a unified framework that leverages MPPI to systematically and fairly compare three distinct objective functions with a consistent dynamics model and parameter set: classical trajectory tracking, contouring control, and the proposed gate progress objective. We compare the performance of these three objectives when solved via both MPPI and a traditional gradient-based solver. Our results demonstrate that the proposed reference-free approach achieves competitive racing performance, rivaling or exceeding reference-based methods.

| **[Controllable Surface Diffusion Generative Model for Neurodevelopmental Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03706v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preterm birth disrupts the typical trajectory of cortical neurodevelopment, increasing the risk of cognitive and behavioral difficulties. However, outcomes vary widely, posing a significant challenge for early prediction. To address this, individualized simulation offers a promising solution by modeling subject-specific neurodevelopmental trajectories, enabling the identification of subtle deviations from normative patterns that might act as biomarkers of risk. While generative models have shown potential for simulating neurodevelopment, prior approaches often struggle to preserve subject-specific cortical folding patterns or to reproduce region-specific morphological variations. In this paper, we present a novel graph-diffusion network that supports controllable simulation of cortical maturation. Using cortical surface data from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP), we demonstrate that the model maintains subject-specific cortical morphology while modeling cortical maturation sufficiently well to fool an independently trained age regression network, achieving a prediction accuracy of $0.85 \pm 0.62$.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Mean of Multi-Object Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20391v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the concept of a mean for trajectories and multi-object trajectories (defined as sets or multi-sets of trajectories) along with algorithms for computing them. Specifically, we use the Fr\'{e}chet mean, and metrics based on the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) construct, to extend the notion of average from vectors to trajectories and multi-object trajectories. Further, we develop efficient algorithms to compute these means using greedy search and Gibbs sampling. Using distributed multi-object tracking as an application, we demonstrate that the Fr\'{e}chet mean approach to multi-object trajectory consensus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed multi-object tracking methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Global Search for Optimal Low Thrust Spacecraft Trajectories using Diffusion Models and the Indirect Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07005v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long time-duration low-thrust nonlinear optimal spacecraft trajectory global search is a computationally and time expensive problem characterized by clustering patterns in locally optimal solutions. During preliminary mission design, mission parameters are subject to frequent changes, necessitating that trajectory designers efficiently generate high-quality control solutions for these new scenarios. Generative machine learning models can be trained to learn how the solution structure varies with respect to a conditional parameter, thereby accelerating the global search for missions with updated parameters. In this work, state-of-the-art diffusion models are integrated with the indirect approach for trajectory optimization within a global search framework. This framework is tested on two low-thrust transfers of different complexity in the circular restricted three-body problem. By generating and analyzing a training data set, we develop mathematical relations and techniques to understand the complex structures in the costate domain of locally optimal solutions for these problems. A diffusion model is trained on this data and successfully accelerates the global search for both problems. The model predicts how the costate solution structure changes, based on the maximum spacecraft thrust magnitude. Warm-starting a numerical solver with diffusion model samples for the costates at the initial time increases the number of solutions generated per minute for problems with unseen thrust magnitudes by one to two orders of magnitude in comparison to samples from a uniform distribution and from an adjoint control transformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ensemble of Pre-Trained Models for Long-Tailed Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13914v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work explores the application of ensemble modeling to the multidimensional regression problem of trajectory prediction for vehicles in urban environments. As newer and bigger state-of-the-art prediction models for autonomous driving continue to emerge, an important open challenge is the problem of how to combine the strengths of these big models without the need for costly re-training. We show how, perhaps surprisingly, combining state-of-the-art deep learning models out-of-the-box (without retraining or fine-tuning) with a simple confidence-weighted average method can enhance the overall prediction. Indeed, while combining trajectory prediction models is not straightforward, this simple approach enhances performance by 10% over the best prediction model, especially in the long-tailed metrics. We show that this performance improvement holds on both the NuScenes and Argoverse datasets, and that these improvements are made across the dataset distribution. The code for our work is open source.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted 2025 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Repulsive Trajectory Modification and Conflict Resolution for Efficient Multi-Manipulator Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13882v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an efficient motion planning method designed to efficiently find collision-free trajectories for multiple manipulators. While multi-manipulator systems offer significant advantages, coordinating their motions is computationally challenging owing to the high dimensionality of their composite configuration space. Conflict-Based Search (CBS) addresses this by decoupling motion planning, but suffers from subsequent conflicts incurred by resolving existing conflicts, leading to an exponentially growing constraint tree of CBS. Our proposed method is based on repulsive trajectory modification within the two-level structure of CBS. Unlike conventional CBS variants, the low-level planner applies a gradient descent approach using an Artificial Potential Field. This field generates repulsive forces that guide the trajectory of the conflicting manipulator away from those of other robots. As a result, subsequent conflicts are less likely to occur. Additionally, we develop a strategy that, under a specific condition, directly attempts to find a conflict-free solution in a single step without growing the constraint tree. Through extensive tests including physical robot experiments, we demonstrate that our method consistently reduces the number of expanded nodes in the constraint tree, achieves a higher success rate, and finds a solution faster compared to Enhanced CBS and other state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[TrajBooster: Boosting Humanoid Whole-Body Manipulation via Trajectory-Centric Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11839v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Vision-Language-Action models show potential to generalize across embodiments but struggle to quickly align with a new robot's action space when high-quality demonstrations are scarce, especially for bipedal humanoids. We present TrajBooster, a cross-embodiment framework that leverages abundant wheeled-humanoid data to boost bipedal VLA. Our key idea is to use end-effector trajectories as a morphology-agnostic interface. TrajBooster (i) extracts 6D dual-arm end-effector trajectories from real-world wheeled humanoids, (ii) retargets them in simulation to Unitree G1 with a whole-body controller trained via a heuristic-enhanced harmonized online DAgger to lift low-dimensional trajectory references into feasible high-dimensional whole-body actions, and (iii) forms heterogeneous triplets that couple source vision/language with target humanoid-compatible actions to post-pre-train a VLA, followed by only 10 minutes of teleoperation data collection on the target humanoid domain. Deployed on Unitree G1, our policy achieves beyond-tabletop household tasks, enabling squatting, cross-height manipulation, and coordinated whole-body motion with markedly improved robustness and generalization. Results show that TrajBooster allows existing wheeled-humanoid data to efficiently strengthen bipedal humanoid VLA performance, reducing reliance on costly same-embodiment data while enhancing action space understanding and zero-shot skill transfer capabilities.

| **[Disturbance-Aware Dynamical Trajectory Planning for Air-Land Bimodal Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05972v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Air-land bimodal vehicles provide a promising solution for navigating complex environments by combining the flexibility of aerial locomotion with the energy efficiency of ground mobility. However, planning dynamically feasible, smooth, collision-free, and energy-efficient trajectories remains challenging due to two key factors: 1) unknown dynamic disturbances in both aerial and terrestrial domains, and 2) the inherent complexity of managing bimodal dynamics with distinct constraint characteristics. This paper proposes a disturbance-aware motion-planning framework that addresses this challenge through real-time disturbance estimation and adaptive trajectory generation. The framework comprises two key components: 1) a disturbance-adaptive safety boundary adjustment mechanism that dynamically determines the feasible region of dynamic constraints for both air and land modes based on estimated disturbances via a disturbance observer, and 2) a constraint-adaptive bimodal motion planner that integrates disturbance-aware path searching to guide trajectories toward regions with reduced disturbances and B-spline-based trajectory optimization to refine trajectories within the established feasible constraint boundaries. Experimental validation on a self-developed air-land bimodal vehicle demonstrates substantial performance improvements across three representative disturbance scenarios, achieving an average 33.9% reduction in trajectory tracking error while still maintaining superior time-energy trade-offs compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Aware: Adaptive Multi-Mode Out-of-Distribution Detection for Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13577v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is central to the safe and seamless operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In deployment, however, prediction models inevitably face distribution shifts between training data and real-world conditions, where rare or underrepresented traffic scenarios induce out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. While most prior OOD detection research in AVs has concentrated on computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation, trajectory-level OOD detection remains largely underexplored. A recent study formulated this problem as a quickest change detection (QCD) task, providing formal guarantees on the trade-off between detection delay and false alarms [1]. Building on this foundation, we propose a new framework that introduces adaptive mechanisms to achieve robust detection in complex driving environments. Empirical analysis across multiple real-world datasets reveals that prediction errors -- even on in-distribution samples -- exhibit mode-dependent distributions that evolve over time with dataset-specific dynamics. By explicitly modeling these error modes, our method achieves substantial improvements in both detection delay and false alarm rates. Comprehensive experiments on established trajectory prediction benchmarks show that our framework significantly outperforms prior UQ- and vision-based OOD approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical path toward reliable, driving-aware autonomy.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[SwiftVideo: A Unified Framework for Few-Step Video Generation through Trajectory-Distribution Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06082v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based or flow-based models have achieved significant progress in video synthesis but require multiple iterative sampling steps, which incurs substantial computational overhead. While many distillation methods that are solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in few-step video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Occupancy-aware Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Valet Parking in Uncertain Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09206v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Valet Parking (AVP) requires planning under partial observability, where parking spot availability evolves as dynamic agents enter and exit spots. Existing approaches either rely only on instantaneous spot availability or make static assumptions, thereby limiting foresight and adaptability. We propose an approach that estimates probability of future spot occupancy by distinguishing initially vacant and occupied spots while leveraging nearby dynamic agent motion. We propose a probabilistic estimator that integrates partial, noisy observations from a limited Field-of-View, with the evolving uncertainty of unobserved spots. Coupled with the estimator, we design a strategy planner that balances goal-directed parking maneuvers with exploratory navigation based on information gain, and incorporates wait-and-go behaviors at promising spots. Through randomized simulations emulating large parking lots, we demonstrate that our framework significantly improves parking efficiency and trajectory smoothness over existing approaches, while maintaining safety margins.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporally Smooth Mesh Extraction for Procedural Scenes with Long-Range Camera Trajectories using Spacetime Octrees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13306v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The procedural occupancy function is a flexible and compact representation for creating 3D scenes. For rasterization and other tasks, it is often necessary to extract a mesh that represents the shape. Unbounded scenes with long-range camera trajectories, such as flying through a forest, pose a unique challenge for mesh extraction. A single static mesh representing all the geometric detail necessary for the full camera path can be prohibitively large. Therefore, independent meshes can be extracted for different camera views, but this approach may lead to popping artifacts during transitions. We propose a temporally coherent method for extracting meshes suitable for long-range camera trajectories in unbounded scenes represented by an occupancy function.

| **[ReTrack: Data Unlearning in Diffusion Models through Redirecting the Denoising Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13007v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse images but suffer from training data memorization, raising critical privacy and safety concerns. Data unlearning has emerged to mitigate this issue by removing the influence of specific data without retraining from scratch. We propose ReTrack, a fast and effective data unlearning method for diffusion models. ReTrack employs importance sampling to construct a more efficient fine-tuning loss, which we approximate by retaining only dominant terms. This yields an interpretable objective that redirects denoising trajectories toward the $k$-nearest neighbors, enabling efficient unlearning while preserving generative quality. Experiments on MNIST T-Shirt, CelebA-HQ, CIFAR-10, and Stable Diffusion show that ReTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, striking the best trade-off between unlearning strength and generation quality preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal graph neural process for reconstruction, extrapolation, and classification of cardiac trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12953v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a probabilistic framework for modeling structured spatiotemporal dynamics from sparse observations, focusing on cardiac motion. Our approach integrates neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and neural processes into a unified model that captures uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure. We represent dynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent trajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context observations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over latent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and extrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic dynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto oscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK Biobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and disease classification capabilities. The model accurately reconstructs trajectories and extrapolates future cardiac cycles from a single observed cycle. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ACDC classification task (up to 99% accuracy), and detects atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank subjects with competitive performance (up to 67% accuracy). This work introduces a flexible approach for analyzing cardiac motion and offers a foundation for graph-based learning in structured biomedical spatiotemporal time-series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[TransDiffuser: Diverse Trajectory Generation with Decorrelated Multi-modal Representation for End-to-end Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09315v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable potential across diverse domains, from vision generation to language modeling. Transferring its generative capabilities to modern end-to-end autonomous driving systems has also emerged as a promising direction. However, existing diffusion-based trajectory generative models often exhibit mode collapse where different random noises converge to similar trajectories after the denoising process.Therefore, state-of-the-art models often rely on anchored trajectories from pre-defined trajectory vocabulary or scene priors in the training set to mitigate collapse and enrich the diversity of generated trajectories, but such inductive bias are not available in real-world deployment, which can be challenged when generalizing to unseen scenarios. In this work, we investigate the possibility of effectively tackling the mode collapse challenge without the assumption of pre-defined trajectory vocabulary or pre-computed scene priors. Specifically, we propose TransDiffuser, an encoder-decoder based generative trajectory planning model, where the encoded scene information and motion states serve as the multi-modal conditional input of the denoising decoder. Different from existing approaches, we exploit a simple yet effective multi-modal representation decorrelation optimization mechanism during the denoising process to enrich the latent representation space which better guides the downstream generation. Without any predefined trajectory anchors or pre-computed scene priors, TransDiffuser achieves the PDMS of 94.85 on the closed-loop planning-oriented benchmark NAVSIM, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative evaluation further showcases TransDiffuser generates more diverse and plausible trajectories which explore more drivable area.</p></details> | Under review |

Existing quadrupedal jumping studies mainly focused on the stance and flight phase by assuming a flat landing ground, which is impractical in many real world cases. This work proposes a safe landing framework that achieves adaptive landing on rough terrains by combining Trajectory Optimization (TO) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) together. The RL agent learns to track the reference motion generated by TO in the environments with rough terrains. To enable the learning of compliant landing skills on challenging terrains, a reward relaxation strategy is synthesized to encourage exploration during landing recovery period. Extensive experiments validate the accurate tracking and safe landing skills benefiting from our proposed method in various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Bio-Inspired Robotic Trajectory Planning via Self-Supervised RNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02171v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning in robotics is understood as generating a sequence of joint configurations that will lead a robotic agent, or its manipulator, from an initial state to the desired final state, thus completing a manipulation task while considering constraints like robot kinematics and the environment. Typically, this is achieved via sampling-based planners, which are computationally intensive. Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning can also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often requiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural architecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised approaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on whether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce observed trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent architecture for building a trajectory model. We evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method on a task of kinematic planning for a robotic arm. The results suggest that the model is able to learn to generate trajectories only using given paired forward and inverse kinematics models, and indicate that this novel method could facilitate planning for more complex manipulation tasks requiring adaptive solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables.

| **[VH-Diffuser: Variable Horizon Diffusion Planner for Time-Aware Goal-Conditioned Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11930v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based planners have gained significant recent attention for their robustness and performance in long-horizon tasks. However, most existing planners rely on a fixed, pre-specified horizon during both training and inference. This rigidity often produces length-mismatch (trajectories that are too short or too long) and brittle performance across instances with varying geometric or dynamical difficulty. In this paper, we introduce the Variable Horizon Diffuser (VHD) framework, which treats the horizon as a learned variable rather than a fixed hyperparameter. Given a start-goal pair, we first predict an instance-specific horizon using a learned Length Predictor model, which guides a Diffusion Planner to generate a trajectory of the desired length. Our design maintains compatibility with existing diffusion planners by controlling trajectory length through initial noise shaping and training on randomly cropped sub-trajectories, without requiring architectural changes. Empirically, VHD improves success rates and path efficiency in maze-navigation and robot-arm control benchmarks, showing greater robustness to horizon mismatch and unseen lengths, while keeping training simple and offline-only.</p></details> |  |
| **[HeLoFusion: An Efficient and Scalable Encoder for Modeling Heterogeneous and Multi-Scale Interactions in Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11719v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory prediction in autonomous driving requires a comprehensive understanding of complex social dynamics. Existing methods, however, often struggle to capture the full richness of these dynamics, particularly the co-existence of multi-scale interactions and the diverse behaviors of heterogeneous agents. To address these challenges, this paper introduces HeLoFusion, an efficient and scalable encoder for modeling heterogeneous and multi-scale agent interactions. Instead of relying on global context, HeLoFusion constructs local, multi-scale graphs centered on each agent, allowing it to effectively model both direct pairwise dependencies and complex group-wise interactions (\textit{e.g.}, platooning vehicles or pedestrian crowds). Furthermore, HeLoFusion tackles the critical challenge of agent heterogeneity through an aggregation-decomposition message-passing scheme and type-specific feature networks, enabling it to learn nuanced, type-dependent interaction patterns. This locality-focused approach enables a principled representation of multi-level social context, yielding powerful and expressive agent embeddings. On the challenging Waymo Open Motion Dataset, HeLoFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting new benchmarks for key metrics including Soft mAP and minADE. Our work demonstrates that a locality-grounded architecture, which explicitly models multi-scale and heterogeneous interactions, is a highly effective strategy for advancing motion forecasting.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory and communication optimization for low-altitude air-ground cooperation systems, where mobile unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) upload data to UAVs. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to maximize the minimal sum-rate of UGVs while ensuring quality of service and navigation constraints. The proposed algorithm integrates a successive convex approximation (SCA)-penalty method for UGV-UAV scheduling, an SCA-based approach for UGV transmit power control, and a novel warm-start particle swarm optimization with cross mutation (WS-PSO-CM). The WS-PSO-CM leverages convex optimization results from a statistical channel model to initialize particle swarm, significantly improving the performance, compared with celebrated PSO-CM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a $45.8$\% higher minimal sum-rate compared to the baseline PSO-CM under the same iterations. This gain can be translated to reducing computational time by $46.7$\% of PSO-CM. Furthermore, our simulation results reveal that UAVs dynamically adjust trajectories to avoid interference by buildings, and maintain proximity to UGVs to mitigate path-loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; 7 figures; accepted by GC-2026-Workshops</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Frame-wise Tracking: A Trajectory-based Paradigm for Efficient Point Cloud Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11453v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical task in robotics and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation, TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers.

| **[DreamNav: A Trajectory-Based Imaginative Framework for Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11197v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE), which links language instructions to perception and control in the real world, is a core capability of embodied robots. Recently, large-scale pretrained foundation models have been leveraged as shared priors for perception, reasoning, and action, enabling zero-shot VLN without task-specific training. However, existing zero-shot VLN methods depend on costly perception and passive scene understanding, collapsing control to point-level choices. As a result, they are expensive to deploy, misaligned in action semantics, and short-sighted in planning. To address these issues, we present DreamNav that focuses on the following three aspects: (1) for reducing sensory cost, our EgoView Corrector aligns viewpoints and stabilizes egocentric perception; (2) instead of point-level actions, our Trajectory Predictor favors global trajectory-level planning to better align with instruction semantics; and (3) to enable anticipatory and long-horizon planning, we propose an Imagination Predictor to endow the agent with proactive thinking capability. On VLN-CE and real-world tests, DreamNav sets a new zero-shot state-of-the-art (SOTA), outperforming the strongest egocentric baseline with extra information by up to 7.49\% and 18.15\% in terms of SR and SPL metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first zero-shot VLN method to unify trajectory-level planning and active imagination while using only egocentric inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tracailer: An Efficient Trajectory Planner for Tractor-Trailer Robots in Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19832v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tractor-trailer robot consists of a drivable tractor and one or more non-drivable trailers connected via hitches. Compared to typical car-like robots, the addition of trailers provides greater transportation capability. However, this also complicates motion planning due to the robot's complex kinematics, high-dimensional state space, and deformable structure. To efficiently plan safe, time-optimal trajectories that adhere to the kinematic constraints of the robot and address the challenges posed by its unique features, this paper introduces a lightweight, compact, and high-order smooth trajectory representation for tractor-trailer robots. Based on it, we design an efficiently solvable spatial-temporal trajectory optimization problem. To deal with deformable structures, which leads to difficulties in collision avoidance, we fully leverage the collisionfree regions of the environment, directly applying deformations to trajectories in continuous space. This approach not requires constructing safe regions from the environment using convex approximations through collision-free seed points before each optimization, avoiding the loss of the solution space, thus reducing the dependency of the optimization on initial values. Moreover, a multi-terminal fast path search algorithm is proposed to generate the initial values for optimization. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves severalfold improvements in efficiency compared to existing algorithms, while also ensuring lower curvature and trajectory duration. Real-world experiments involving the transportation, loading and unloading of goods in both indoor and outdoor scenarios further validate the effectiveness of our method.

Existing methods struggle with sparse data, incomplete routes, and limited modeling of complex spatial dependencies, often relying on low-level check-in data or ignoring spatial patterns. In this paper, we introduced GCN-TULHOR, a method that transforms raw location data into higher-order mobility flow representations using hexagonal tessellation, reducing data sparsity and capturing richer spatial semantics, and integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Our approach converts both sparse check-in and continuous GPS trajectory data into unified higher-order flow representations, mitigating sparsity while capturing deeper semantic information. The GCN layer explicitly models complex spatial relationships and non-local dependencies without requiring side information such as timestamps or points of interest. Experiments on six real-world datasets show consistent improvements over classical baselines, RNN- and Transformer-based models, and the TULHOR method in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. GCN-TULHOR achieves 1-8% relative gains in accuracy and F1. Sensitivity analysis identifies an optimal setup with a single GCN layer and 512-dimensional embeddings. The integration of GCNs enhances spatial learning and improves generalizability across mobility data. This work highlights the value of combining graph-based spatial learning with sequential modeling, offering a robust and scalable solution for TUL with applications in recommendations, urban planning, and security.</p></details> |  |

The new estimate is $O(N^{-1/2})$, with a constant related to the probability of success of the bound, given by Hoeffding's inequality, similar to other methodologies, such as Philipp et al. Furthermore, we propose a \textit{lifting back} operator to obtain trajectories generated by embedding the initial state and iterating a linear system in a higher dimension. This naturally yields an $O(N^{-1/2})$ error bound for mean trajectories. Finally, we show numerical results including an example of nonlinear system, exhibiting successful approximation with exponential decay faster than $-1/2$, as suggested by the theoretical results.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

To improve prediction accuracy, recent approaches often rely on pre-built high-definition (HD) maps or real-time local map construction modules to incorporate static environmental information. However, pre-built HD maps are limited to specific regions and cannot adapt to transient changes. In addition, local map construction modules, which recognize only predefined elements, may fail to capture critical scene details or introduce errors that degrade prediction performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Bird's-Eye View Trajectory Prediction (BEVTraj), a novel trajectory prediction framework that operates directly in the bird's-eye view (BEV) space utilizing real-time sensor data without relying on any pre-built maps. The BEVTraj leverages deformable attention to efficiently extract relevant context from dense BEV features. Furthermore, we introduce a Sparse Goal Candidate Proposal (SGCP) module, which enables full end-to-end prediction without requiring any post-processing steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the BEVTraj achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art HD map-based models while offering greater flexibility by eliminating the dependency on pre-built maps.

In response, analyses of social media (SM) language have gained prominence due to their high temporal resolution and longitudinal scope. Here, we introduce a method to determine the timing of users' diagnoses and apply it to study language trajectories from 3 years before to 21 years after BD diagnosis - contrasted with uses reporting unipolar depression (UD) and non-affected users (HC). We show that BD diagnosis is accompanied by pervasive linguistic alterations reflecting mood disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, substance abuse, hospitalization, medical comorbidities, unusual thought content, and disorganized thought. We further observe recurring mood-related language changes across two decades after the diagnosis, with a pronounced 12-month periodicity suggestive of seasonal mood episodes. Finally, trend-level evidence suggests an increased periodicity in users estimated to be female. In sum, our findings provide evidence for language alterations in the acute and chronic phase of BD. This validates and extends recent efforts leveraging SM for scalable monitoring of mental health.</p></details> | Pre-print |

Although exploration reduces human effort, it lacks safety guarantees and often results in frequent collisions -- particularly in clearance-limited tasks (e.g., peg-in-hole) -- thereby, necessitating manual environmental resets and imposing additional human burden. This study proposes Self-Augmented Robot Trajectory (SART), a framework that enables policy learning from a single human demonstration, while safely expanding the dataset through autonomous augmentation. SART consists of two stages: (1) human teaching only once, where a single demonstration is provided and precision boundaries -- represented as spheres around key waypoints -- are annotated, followed by one environment reset; (2) robot self-augmentation, where the robot generates diverse, collision-free trajectories within these boundaries and reconnects to the original demonstration. This design improves the data collection efficiency by minimizing human effort while ensuring safety. Extensive evaluations in simulation and real-world manipulation tasks show that SART achieves substantially higher success rates than policies trained solely on human-collected demonstrations.

Existing methods typically rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets. Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification, which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and zero-shot approaches.</p></details> |  |

Although conventional deep learning methods have improved accuracy, they remain hindered by inherent limitations, including lack of interpretability, heavy reliance on large-scale annotated data, and weak generalization in long-tail scenarios. The rise of Large Foundation Models (LFMs) is transforming the research paradigm of trajectory prediction. This survey offers a systematic review of recent advances in LFMs, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for trajectory prediction. By integrating linguistic and scene semantics, LFMs facilitate interpretable contextual reasoning, significantly enhancing prediction safety and generalization in complex environments. The article highlights three core methodologies: trajectory-language mapping, multimodal fusion, and constraint-based reasoning. It covers prediction tasks for both vehicles and pedestrians, evaluation metrics, and dataset analyses. Key challenges such as computational latency, data scarcity, and real-world robustness are discussed, along with future research directions including low-latency inference, causality-aware modeling, and motion foundation models.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities: coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose an Interaction-Enriched Unified Potential Field (IUPF) framework that fuses style-dependent benefit and risk fields through a physics-inspired variational model, grounded in mean field game theory. The approach captures conservative, aggressive, and cooperative behaviors without additional safety modules, and employs stochastic differential equations to guarantee Nash equilibrium with exponential convergence. Simulations on lane changing and overtaking scenarios show that IUPF ensures safe distances, generates smooth and efficient trajectories, and outperforms traditional optimization and game-theoretic baselines in both adaptability and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

To ensure the existence of the trajectory derivatives, the trajectory function is reparameterized as a piecewise cubic polynomial function with $C^2$ continuity. To ensure trajectory fidelity, the output gradient waveform is reparameterized by the finite difference of the trajectory samples. Simulation experiments across seven commonly adopted non-Cartesian trajectories were conducted to validate generality, time-optimality, real-time capability, slew-rate accuracy, and improvements over prior work. Imaging feasibility of the designed time-optimal gradient waveform was validated in phantom and in vivo experiments. \textbf{Results: }The proposed method achieves a $>89\%$ reduction in computation time and simultaneously reduces slew-rate overshoot by $>98\%$ compared to the prior method across all involved trajectories. The computation time of the proposed method is shorter than the gradient duration for all tested cases, validating the real-time capability of the proposed method. \textbf{Conclusions: }The proposed method enables real-time and hardware-compliant gradient waveform design, achieving significant reductions in computation time and slew-rate overshoot compared to the previous method. \textbf{Significance: }This is the first method achieving real-time gradient waveform design for arbitrary $k$-space trajectories.</p></details> |  |

While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Generalized Hamiltonian Dynamics with Stability from Noisy Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07280v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a robust framework for learning various generalized Hamiltonian dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data and in an unsupervised manner based on variational Bayesian inference. Although conservative, dissipative, and port-Hamiltonian systems might share the same initial total energy of a closed system, it is challenging for a single Hamiltonian network model to capture the distinctive and varying motion dynamics and physics of a phase space, from sampled observational phase space trajectories. To address this complicated Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge, we extend sparse symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes learning with predictive successive numerical estimations of the Hamiltonian landscape, using a generalized form of state and conjugate momentum Hamiltonian dynamics, appropriate to different classes of conservative, dissipative and port-Hamiltonian physical systems. In addition to the kernelized evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation constraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the model's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction accuracy with bounded uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often assume fixed graph structures and require retraining when network conditions change, making them unsuitable for deployment on constrained hardware. We present TrajAware, an RL-based framework designed for edge AI deployment in VANETs. TrajAware integrates three components: (i) action space pruning, which reduces redundant neighbour options while preserving two-hop reachability, alleviating the curse of dimensionality; (ii) graph cross-attention, which maps pruned neighbours to the global graph context, producing features that generalise across diverse network sizes; and (iii) trajectory-aware prediction, which uses historical routes and junction information to estimate real-time positions under partial observations. We evaluate TrajAware in the open-source SUMO simulator using real-world city maps with a leave-one-city-out setup. Results show that TrajAware achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Resident fitness computation in linear time and other algorithmic aspects of interacting trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11561v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The notion of a system of interacting trajectories was recently introduced by Hermann, Gonz\'alez Casanova, Soares dos Santos, T\'obi\'as and Wakolbinger. Such a system of $[0,1]$-valued piecewise linear trajectories arises as a scaling limit of the system of logarithmic subpopulation sizes in a population-genetic model (more precisely, a Moran model) with mutation and selection. By definition, the resident fitness is initially 0 and afterwards it increases by the ultimate slope of each trajectory that reaches height 1. We show that although the interaction of $n$ trajectories may yield $\Omega(n^2)$ slope changes in total, the resident fitness function can be computed algorithmically in $O(n)$ time. Our algorithm uses the so-called continued lines representation of the system of interacting trajectories. In the special case of Poissonian interacting trajectories where the birth times of the trajectories form a Poisson process and the initial slopes are random and i.i.d., we provide a linear bound on the expected total number of slope changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v5)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

| **[Statistical description and dimension reduction of categorical trajectories with multivariate functional principal components](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09986v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are many examples in which the statistical units of interest are samples of a continuous time categorical random process, that is to say a continuous time stochastic process taking values in a finite state space. Getting simple representations that allow comparisons of a set of trajectories is of major interest for statisticians. Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical description of the categorical trajectories into a multivariate functional principal components analysis. The (multivariate) covariance operator has nice interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities and the multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, it is simple to build consistent estimators of the covariance kernel and perform multivariate functional principal components analysis. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories are not supposed to be continuous and can be observed exhaustively. The approach is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments. We also show how it can be easily extended to analyze experiments, such as temporal check-all-that-apply, in which two states or more can be observed at the same time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe and Economical UAV Trajectory Planning in Low-Altitude Airspace: A Hybrid DRL-LLM Approach with Compliance Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08532v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of the low-altitude economy has driven the widespread adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This growing deployment presents new challenges for UAV trajectory planning in complex urban environments. However, existing studies often overlook key factors, such as urban airspace constraints and economic efficiency, which are essential in low-altitude economy contexts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising solution to these issues, while its practical adoption remains limited by low learning efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel UAV trajectory planning framework that combines DRL with large language model (LLM) reasoning to enable safe, compliant, and economically viable path planning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple metrics, including data collection rate, collision avoidance, successful landing, regulatory compliance, and energy efficiency. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing UAV trajectory planning key challenges under constraints of the low-altitude economy networking.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior learning-based methods, ZLATTE leverages Vision-Language Models to register objects as geometric primitives and employs a Large Language Model to translate natural language instructions into explicit geometric and kinematic constraints. These constraints are integrated into a potential field optimization to adapt initial trajectories while preserving feasibility and safety. A multi-agent strategy further enhances robustness under complex or conflicting commands. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that ZLATTE achieves smoother, safer, and more interpretable trajectory modifications compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Scaling of Diffusion Models via Noise Trajectory Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03164v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The iterative and stochastic nature of diffusion models enables test-time scaling, whereby spending additional compute during denoising generates higher-fidelity samples. Increasing the number of denoising steps is the primary scaling axis, but this yields quickly diminishing returns. Instead optimizing the noise trajectory--the sequence of injected noise vectors--is promising, as the specific noise realizations critically affect sample quality; but this is challenging due to a high-dimensional search space, complex noise-outcome interactions, and costly trajectory evaluations. We address this by first casting diffusion as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a terminal reward, showing tree-search methods such as Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to be meaningful but impractical. To balance performance and efficiency, we then resort to a relaxation of MDP, where we view denoising as a sequence of independent contextual bandits. This allows us to introduce an $\epsilon$-greedy search algorithm that globally explores at extreme timesteps and locally exploits during the intermediate steps where de-mixing occurs. Experiments on EDM and Stable Diffusion reveal state-of-the-art scores for class-conditioned/text-to-image generation, exceeding baselines by up to $164\%$ and matching/exceeding MCTS performance. To our knowledge, this is the first practical method for test-time noise trajectory optimization of arbitrary (non-differentiable) rewards.</p></details> |  |
| **[MENSA: A Multi-Event Network for Survival Analysis with Trajectory-based Likelihood Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06525v4)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing time-to-event methods focus on either single-event or competing-risk settings, leaving multi-event scenarios relatively underexplored. In many real-world applications, the same patient may experience multiple events that are non-exclusive, and sometimes semi-competing. A common workaround is to train separate single-event models, but this approach fails to exploit dependencies and shared structure across events. To address these limitations, we propose MENSA (Multi-Event Network for Survival Analysis), a deep learning model that jointly models flexible time-to-event distributions for multiple events, whether competing or co-occurring. In addition, we introduce a novel trajectory-based likelihood that captures the temporal ordering between events. Across five benchmark datasets, MENSA consistently improves prediction performance over many state-of-the-art baselines.

| **[Efficient Virtuoso: A Latent Diffusion Transformer Model for Goal-Conditioned Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03658v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems. While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity, computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present the Efficient Virtuoso, a conditional latent diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, achieving a minimum Average Displacement Error (minADE) of 0.25. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Effective Trajectory Planning and an Optimized Path Planning for a 6-Degree-of-Freedom Robot Manipulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00828v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An effective method for optimizing path planning for a specific model of a 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator is presented as part of the motion planning of the manipulator using computer algebra. We assume that we are given a path in the form of a set of line segments that the end-effector should follow. We also assume that we have a method to solve the inverse kinematic problem of the manipulator at each via-point of the trajectory. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, we calculate the feasible region of the manipulator under a specific configuration of the end-effector. Next, we aim to find a trajectory on the line segments and a sequence of joint configurations the manipulator should follow to move the end-effector along the specified trajectory. Finally, we find the optimal combination of solutions to the inverse kinematic problem at each via-point along the trajectory by reducing the problem to a shortest-path problem of the graph and applying Dijkstra's algorithm. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by experiments.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Learning to Coordinate: Distributed Meta-Trajectory Optimization Via Differentiable ADMM-DDP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01630v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Acceleration Preconditioners for Parametric Radiative Transfer Equations based on Trajectory-Aware Reduced Order Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05001v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The parametric radiative transfer equation (RTE) arises in multi-query applications, such as design optimization, inverse problems, and uncertainty quantification, which require solving the RTE multiple times for various parameters. Classical synthetic acceleration (SA) preconditioners are designed based on low-order approximations of a kinetic correction equation, e.g., its diffusion limit in diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA). Despite their widespread success, these methods rely on empirical physical assumptions and do not leverage low-rank structures across parameters of the parametric problem. To address these limitations, our previous work introduced a reduced-order model (ROM) enhanced preconditioner called ROMSAD, which exploits low-rank structures across parameters and the original kinetic description of the correction equation. While ROMSAD improves overall efficiency compared with DSA, its efficiency reduces after the first iteration, because the construction of the underlying ROM ignores the preconditioner-dependence of the residual trajectory, leading to a mismatch between the offline and online residual trajectories. To overcome this issue, we introduce a trajectory-aware framework that iteratively constructs ROMs to eliminate the mismatch between offline and online residual trajectories. Numerical tests demonstrate superior efficiency over DSA, and substantial gains in both efficiency and robustness over ROMSAD. For a parametric lattice problem, trajectory-aware ROM preconditioners achieve rapid convergence within only $2$-$3$ iterations online.</p></details> | 32 pages, 9 figures |

While human-motion-centric approaches excel in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods. Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in global human motion reconstruction.

STO maintains the maneuver strategy of the high-level global planner while allowing curvature discontinuities at switching points to improve maneuver efficiency. To ensure safety, a convex corridor is constructed via GJK-accelerated ellipse shrinking and expansion, serving as safety constraints in each iteration. Numerical simulations in perpendicular and reverse-angled parking scenarios demonstrate that STO enhances maneuver efficiency while ensuring safety. Moreover, computational performance confirms its practicality for real-world applications.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

However, traditional IL methods are limited by their reliance on high-quality, often scarce, expert data, and suffer from covariate shift. To address these challenges, recent advances in offline IL have incorporated suboptimal, unlabeled datasets into the training. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance policy learning from mixed-quality offline datasets by leveraging task-relevant trajectory fragments and rich environmental dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a state-based search framework that stitches state-action pairs from imperfect demonstrations, generating more diverse and informative training trajectories. Experimental results on standard IL benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks showcase that our proposed method significantly improves both generalization and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can the Waymo Open Motion Dataset Support Realistic Behavioral Modeling? A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03515v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations. Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably, WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving. Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without proper validation against independently collected data.</p></details> |  |

For control purposes, the model is structured as a cascade system, where a rotational subsystem drives a translational one. The rotational subsystem is linear, while the translational subsystem follows a linear-plus-perturbation form, thereby reducing the complexity of control design. A control strategy requiring only simple operations, no memory, and no iterative search loops is presented to illustrate the main features of the GA model. By employing GA to model both translations and rotations, a singularity-free and geometrically intuitive representation can be achieved through the use of the geometric product. Closed-loop stability is rigorously established using input-to-state stability methods. Numerical simulations of a quad tilt-rotorcraft performing trajectory tracking in a windy environment validate the controller's stability and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE TAES for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[KEPT: Knowledge-Enhanced Prediction of Trajectories from Consecutive Driving Frames with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02966v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars. Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion, and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset, KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising, data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

Still, existing data-driven models are constrained mainly to single-vessel forecasting, overlooking vessel interactions, navigation rules, and explicit collision risk assessment. We present a transformer-based framework for multi-vessel trajectory prediction with integrated collision risk analysis. For a given target vessel, the framework identifies nearby vessels. It jointly predicts their future trajectories through parallel streams encoding kinematic and derived physical features, causal convolutions for temporal locality, spatial transformations for positional encoding, and hybrid positional embeddings that capture both local motion patterns and long-range dependencies. Evaluated on large-scale real-world AIS data using joint multi-vessel metrics, the model demonstrates superior forecasting capabilities beyond traditional single-vessel displacement errors. By simulating interactions among predicted trajectories, the framework further quantifies potential collision risks, offering actionable insights to strengthen maritime safety and decision support.</p></details> |  |

The outer-loop controller generates an acceleration reference, which is then converted into attitude and angular velocity references, later tracked by a nonlinear inner-loop controller. Numerical simulations validate the approach, demonstrating enhanced performance in precise and fast tracking by imposing less conservative constraints than existing approaches, while still guaranteeing stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, submitted to 2025 IEEE 64th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)</p></details> |
| **[Relative Trajectory Balance is equivalent to Trust-PCL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01632v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in generative modeling has highlighted the importance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for fine-tuning, with KL-regularized methods in particular proving to be highly effective for both autoregressive and diffusion models. Complementing this line of work, the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB) objective was recently introduced in the context of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to serve the same role of improving fine-tuning in sequential generative models. Building on prior work linking GFlowNets and maximum-entropy RL, we establish in this paper an equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL, an off-policy RL method with KL regularization. This equivalence situates RTB within the broader theoretical landscape of KL-regularized RL, and clarifies its relationship to earlier methods. Leveraging this insight, we revisit an illustrative example from the RTB paper and show that KL-regularized RL methods achieve comparable performance, offering an alternative perspective to what was previously reported.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using iterated local alignment to aggregate trajectory data into a traffic flow map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17500v6)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectories are a promising GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) data source to compute multi-scale traffic flow maps ranging from the city/regional level to the road level. The main obstacle is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for city level, large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial difficulties for road level, small-scale aggregation. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales for static and interactive maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedResearcher-R1: Expert-Level Medical Deep Researcher via A Knowledge-Informed Trajectory Synthesis Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14880v3)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown impressive capabilities spanning multiple domains, exemplified by deep research systems that demonstrate superior performance on complex information-seeking and synthesis tasks. While general-purpose deep research agents have shown impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored for medical contexts. We present a medical deep research agent that addresses these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool interactions. Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Metamorphic Testing of Multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01294v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Predicting human trajectories is crucial for the safety and reliability of autonomous systems, such as automated vehicles and mobile robots. However, rigorously testing the underlying multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) models, which typically use multiple input sources (e.g., trajectory history and environment maps) and produce stochastic outputs (multiple possible future paths), presents significant challenges. The primary difficulty lies in the absence of a definitive test oracle, as numerous future trajectories might be plausible for any given scenario. Objectives: This research presents the application of Metamorphic Testing (MT) as a systematic methodology for testing multimodal HTP systems. We address the oracle problem through metamorphic relations (MRs) adapted for the complexities and stochastic nature of HTP. Methods: We present five MRs, targeting transformations of both historical trajectory data and semantic segmentation maps used as an environmental context. These MRs encompass: 1) label-preserving geometric transformations (mirroring, rotation, rescaling) applied to both trajectory and map inputs, where outputs are expected to transform correspondingly. 2) Map-altering transformations (changing semantic class labels, introducing obstacles) with predictable changes in trajectory distributions. We propose probabilistic violation criteria based on distance metrics between probability distributions, such as the Wasserstein or Hellinger distance. Conclusion: This study introduces tool, a MT framework for the oracle-less testing of multimodal, stochastic HTP systems. It allows for assessment of model robustness against input transformations and contextual changes without reliance on ground-truth trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Infor...</summary><p>Information and Software Technology</p></details> |
| **[Toward a Holistic Multi-Criteria Trajectory Evaluation Framework for Autonomous Driving in Mixed Traffic Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01291v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a unified framework for the evaluation and optimization of autonomous vehicle trajectories, integrating formal safety, comfort, and efficiency criteria. An innovative geometric indicator, based on the analysis of safety zones using adaptive ellipses, is used to accurately quantify collision risks. Our method applies the Shoelace formula to compute the intersection area in the case of misaligned and time-varying configurations. Comfort is modeled using indicators centered on longitudinal and lateral jerk, while efficiency is assessed by overall travel time. These criteria are aggregated into a comprehensive objective function solved using a PSO based algorithm. The approach was successfully validated under real traffic conditions via experiments conducted in an urban intersection involving an autonomous vehicle interacting with a human-operated vehicle, and in simulation using data recorded from human driving in real traffic.</p></details> |  |
| **[MVTrajecter: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking with Trajectory Motion Cost and Trajectory Appearance Cost](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01157v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association. MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition, MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

While existing trajectory planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i) a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives, providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.</p></details> |  |

Although data acquisition using drones is efficient, existing datasets still have limitations in scene representativeness, information richness, and data fidelity. This study introduces FLUID, comprising a fine-grained trajectory dataset that captures dense conflicts at typical urban signalized intersections, and a lightweight, full-pipeline framework for drone-based trajectory processing. FLUID covers three distinct intersection types, with approximately 5 hours of recording time and featuring over 20,000 TPs across 8 categories. Notably, the dataset averages two vehicle conflicts per minute, involving roughly 25% of all motor vehicles. FLUID provides comprehensive data, including trajectories, traffic signals, maps, and raw videos. Comparison with the DataFromSky platform and ground-truth measurements validates its high spatio-temporal accuracy. Through a detailed classification of motor vehicle conflicts and violations, FLUID reveals a diversity of interactive behaviors, demonstrating its value for human preference mining, traffic behavior modeling, and autonomous driving research.</p></details> | 26 pages, 14 figures |

Using the two-scale Lorenz '96 system as a case study, we develop and train both additive and multiplicative stochastic parametrizations to generate ensemble predictions. Results indicate that CRPS-based trajectory learning produces parametrizations that are both accurate and sharp. The resulting parametrizations are straightforward to calibrate and outperform derivative-fitting-based parametrizations in short-term forecasts.

| **[Temporal Flow Matching for Learning Spatio-Temporal Trajectories in 4D Longitudinal Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21580v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions. While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e. predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports $3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.</p></details> |  |

Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for generating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory. This process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion model to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic videos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly reducing human intervention requirements. Experimental results demonstrate superior visual quality compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8page...</summary><p>8pages; 7figures; 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Dynamics-Compliant Trajectory Diffusion for Super-Nominal Payload Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21375v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nominal payload ratings for articulated robots are typically derived from worst-case configurations, resulting in uniform payload constraints across the entire workspace. This conservative approach severely underutilizes the robot's inherent capabilities -- our analysis demonstrates that manipulators can safely handle payloads well above nominal capacity across broad regions of their workspace while staying within joint angle, velocity, acceleration, and torque limits. To address this gap between assumed and actual capability, we propose a novel trajectory generation approach using denoising diffusion models that explicitly incorporates payload constraints into the planning process. Unlike traditional sampling-based methods that rely on inefficient trial-and-error, optimization-based methods that are prohibitively slow, or kinodynamic planners that struggle with problem dimensionality, our approach generates dynamically feasible joint-space trajectories in constant time that can be directly executed on physical hardware without post-processing. Experimental validation on a 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrates that up to 67.6% of the workspace remains accessible even with payloads exceeding 3 times the nominal capacity. This expanded operational envelope highlights the importance of a more nuanced consideration of payload dynamics in motion planning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 Conference on Robot Learning [CoRL]</p></details> |
| **[BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05762v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Manifold Trajectories in Next-Token Prediction: From Replicator Dynamics to Softmax Equilibrium](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21186v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comparative Study of Spline-Based Trajectory Reconstruction Methods Across Varying Automatic Vehicle Location Data Densities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00119v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic vehicle location (AVL) data offers insights into transit dynamics, but its effectiveness is often hampered by inconsistent update frequencies, necessitating trajectory reconstruction. This research evaluates 13 trajectory reconstruction methods, including several novel approaches, using high-resolution AVL data from Austin, Texas. We examine the interplay of four critical factors -- velocity, position, smoothing, and data density -- on reconstruction performance. A key contribution of this study is evaluation of these methods across sparse and dense datasets, providing insights into the trade-off between accuracy and resource allocation. Our evaluation framework combines traditional mathematical error metrics for positional and velocity with practical considerations, such as physical realism (e.g., aligning velocity and acceleration with stopped states, deceleration rates, and speed variability). In addition, we provide insight into the relative value of each method in calculating realistic metrics for infrastructure evaluations. Our findings indicate that velocity-aware methods consistently outperform position-only approaches. Interestingly, we discovered that smoothing-based methods can degrade overall performance in complex, congested urban environments, although enforcing monotonicity remains critical. The velocity constrained Hermite interpolation with monotonicity enforcement (VCHIP-ME) yields optimal results, offering a balance between high accuracy and computational efficiency. Its minimal overhead makes it suitable for both historical analysis and real-time applications, providing significant predictive power when combined with dense datasets. These findings offer practical guidance for researchers and practitioners implementing trajectory reconstruction systems and emphasize the importance of investing in higher-frequency AVL data collection for improved analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeMat-Traj: A Scalable and Unified Dataset of Materials Trajectories for Atomistic Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20875v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs. LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued evolution of large-scale materials datasets.

However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher.

The investigation of these dynamics can provide a better understanding of diffusing objects and their surrounding media, but a quantitative characterization from individual trajectories is often challenging. Efforts devoted to improving anomalous diffusion detection using classical statistics and machine learning have produced several new methods. Recently, the anomalous diffusion challenge (AnDi, www.andi-challenge.org) was launched to objectively assess these approaches on a common dataset, focusing on three aspects of anomalous diffusion: the inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent; the classification of the diffusion model; and the segmentation of trajectories. In this article, I describe a simple approach to tackle the tasks of the AnDi challenge by combining extreme learning machine and feature engineering (AnDi-ELM). The method reaches satisfactory performance while offering a straightforward implementation and fast training time with limited computing resources, making it a suitable tool for fast preliminary screening of anomalous diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

For large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI, and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator (SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL) module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best compared methods on four HSI datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/jhqi/SSGCO-EGAEL.</p></details> |  |

However, their application to graph structured data, where capturing topological connections is essential, remains underexplored and underperforming compared to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly in the graph clustering task. GNN tends to overemphasize neighborhood aggregation, leading to a homogenization of node representations. Conversely, Transformer tends to over globalize, highlighting distant nodes at the expense of meaningful local patterns. This dichotomy raises a key question: Is attention inherently redundant for unsupervised graph learning? To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis, uncovering the complementary weaknesses of GNN and Transformer in graph clustering. Motivated by these insights, we propose the Attentive Graph Clustering Network (AGCN) a novel architecture that reinterprets the notion that graph is attention. AGCN directly embeds the attention mechanism into the graph structure, enabling effective global information extraction while maintaining sensitivity to local topological cues. Our framework incorporates theoretical analysis to contrast AGCN behavior with GNN and Transformer and introduces two innovations: (1) a KV cache mechanism to improve computational efficiency, and (2) a pairwise margin contrastive loss to boost the discriminative capacity of the attention space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

It employs an online data quality monitoring (DQM) system to promptly spot and diagnose particle data acquisition problems to avoid data quality loss. In this study, we present a semi-supervised spatio-temporal anomaly detection (AD) monitoring system for the physics particle reading channels of the Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) of the CMS using three-dimensional digi-occupancy map data of the DQM. We propose the GraphSTAD system, which employs convolutional and graph neural networks to learn local spatial characteristics induced by particles traversing the detector and the global behavior owing to shared backend circuit connections and housing boxes of the channels, respectively. Recurrent neural networks capture the temporal evolution of the extracted spatial features.

Due to the elusive syntax and complicated semantics in programs, most existing studies use techniques based on abstract syntax tree (AST) and graph neural networks (GNN) to create code representations for code classification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information of the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect the high-order data correlations that already exist between nodes of the same field or called attribute in the AST, which may result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while a general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous and undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural information such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes and parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) to represent AST and a heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) to process the graph for code classification. Our method improves code understanding and can represent high-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess our heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of Python and Java programs. Our method outperforms previous AST-based and GNN-based methods, which demonstrates the capability of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 35th International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE 2023) as a regular paper; the latest version is consistent with the official conference version</p></details> |

The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to attention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention scheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures long-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer from information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN could be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer, featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network layers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper layers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby preventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective cross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to retain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information loss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of the global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with state-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks. The results indicate that G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping linear complexity.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, their robustness, especially on heterogeneous graphs, remains underexplored, particularly against adversarial attacks. This paper proposes HeteroKRLAttack, a targeted evasion black-box attack method for heterogeneous graphs. By integrating reinforcement learning with a Top-K algorithm to reduce the action space, our method efficiently identifies effective attack strategies to disrupt node classification tasks. We validate the effectiveness of HeteroKRLAttack through experiments on multiple heterogeneous graph datasets, showing significant reductions in classification accuracy compared to baseline methods. An ablation study underscores the critical role of the Top-K algorithm in enhancing attack performance.

However, current methods exhibit limited performance when handling hypergraphs, which inherently represent complex high-order relationships beyond pairwise connections. Partitioning hypergraph structures across federated subsystems amplifies structural complexity, hindering high-order information mining and compromising local information integrity. To bridge the gap between hypergraph learning and federated systems, we develop FedHGL, a first-of-its-kind framework for federated hypergraph learning on disjoint and privacy-constrained hypergraph partitions. Beyond collaboratively training a comprehensive hypergraph neural network across multiple clients, FedHGL introduces a pre-propagation hyperedge completion mechanism to preserve high-order structural integrity within each client. This procedure leverages the federated central server to perform cross-client hypergraph convolution without exposing internal topological information, effectively mitigating the high-order information loss induced by subgraph partitioning. Furthermore, by incorporating two kinds of local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms, we provide formal privacy guarantees for this process, ensuring that sensitive node features remain protected against inference attacks from potentially malicious servers or clients. Experimental results on seven real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate its performance advantages over traditional federated graph learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE International Conference on Data Mining 2025 (ICDM2025)</p></details> |
| **[General Geospatial Inference with a Population Dynamics Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07207v5)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supporting the health and well-being of dynamic populations around the world requires governmental agencies, organizations and researchers to understand and reason over complex relationships between human behavior and local contexts in order to identify high-risk groups and strategically allocate limited resources. Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks. We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting. The full set of embeddings and sample code are publicly available for researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, preprint; v5: updated authors</p></details> |
| **[Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Sample-Efficient and Generalizable Swarm Robot Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14431v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for coordinating swarms of agents in complex decision-making, yet major challenges remain. In competitive settings such as pursuer-evader tasks, simultaneous adaptation can destabilize training; non-kinetic countermeasures often fail under adverse conditions; and policies trained in one configuration rarely generalize to environments with a different number of agents. To address these issues, we propose the Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (LEGO) framework, which integrates seamlessly with popular MARL algorithms such as MAPPO. LEGO employs graph neural networks to capture permutation equivariance and generalization to different agent numbers, canonicalization to enforce E(n)-equivariance, and heterogeneous representations to encode role-specific inductive biases. Experiments on cooperative and competitive swarm benchmarks show that LEGO outperforms strong baselines and improves generalization. In real-world experiments, LEGO demonstrates robustness to varying team sizes and agent failure.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

It offers insights into collective behavior and decision-making, with applications in Graph Neural Networks. Existing models propose that individuals form opinions based on a weighted average of their peers' opinions and their own beliefs. This averaging process, viewed as a best-response game, can be seen as an individual minimizing disagreements with peers, defined by a quadratic penalty, leading to an equilibrium. Bindel, Kleinberg, and Oren (FOCS 2011) provided tight bounds on the "price of anarchy" defined as the maximum overall disagreement at equilibrium relative to a social optimum. Bhawalkar, Gollapudi, and Munagala (STOC 2013) generalized the penalty function to non-quadratic penalties and provided tight bounds on the price of anarchy. When considering multiple topics, an individual's opinions can be represented as a vector. Parsegov, Proskurnikov, Tempo, and Friedkin (2016) proposed a multidimensional model using the weighted averaging process, but with constant interdependencies between topics. However, the question of the price of anarchy for this model remained open. We address this by providing tight bounds on the multidimensional model, while also generalizing it to more complex interdependencies. Following the work of Bhawalkar, Gollapudi, and Munagala, we provide tight bounds on the price of anarchy under non-quadratic penalties. Surprisingly, these bounds match the scalar model. We further demonstrate that the bounds remain unchanged even when adding another layer of complexity, involving groups of individuals minimizing their overall internal and external disagreement penalty, a common occurrence in real-life scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared in 26th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC'25)</p></details> |

However, current staging models are hardly interpretable, and most public datasets contain no clinical reasoning or interpretation beyond image-level labels. In this paper, we present a novel method that integrates graph representation learning with vision-language models (VLMs) to deliver explainable DR diagnosis. Our approach leverages optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images by constructing biologically informed graphs that encode key retinal vascular features such as vessel morphology and spatial connectivity. A graph neural network (GNN) then performs DR staging while integrated gradients highlight critical nodes and edges and their individual features that drive the classification decisions. We collect this graph-based knowledge which attributes the model's prediction to physiological structures and their characteristics. We then transform it into textual descriptions for VLMs. We perform instruction-tuning with these textual descriptions and the corresponding image to train a student VLM. This final agent can classify the disease and explain its decision in a human interpretable way solely based on a single image input. Experimental evaluations on both proprietary and public datasets demonstrate that our method not only improves classification accuracy but also offers more clinically interpretable results. An expert study further demonstrates that our method provides more accurate diagnostic explanations and paves the way for precise localization of pathologies in OCTA images.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

Existing studies remain fragmented, and there is a lack of comprehensive guidance on how GNNs can be systematically applied to NG-IoT systems. As NG-IoT systems evolve toward 6G, they incorporate diverse technologies. These advances promise unprecedented connectivity, sensing, and automation but also introduce significant complexity, requiring new approaches for scalable learning, dynamic optimization, and secure, decentralized decision-making. This survey provides a comprehensive and forward-looking exploration of how GNNs can empower NG-IoT environments. We commence by exploring the fundamental paradigms of GNNs and articulating the motivation for their use in NG-IoT networks. Besides, we intrinsically connect GNNs with the family of low-density parity-check codes, modeling the NG-IoT as dynamic constrained graphs. We highlight the distinct roles of node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks in tackling key challenges and demonstrate the GNNs' ability to overcome the limitations of traditional optimization. We examine the application of GNNs across core NG-enabling technologies and their integration with distributed frameworks to support privacy-preservation and distributed intelligence. We then delve into the challenges posed by adversarial attacks, offering insights into defense mechanisms. Lastly, we examine how GNNs can be integrated with emerging technologies. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of GNNs in improving efficiency, scalability, and security. Finally, we summarize the key lessons learned and outline promising future research directions, along with a set of design guidelines tailored for NG-IoT applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 18 figures, and 6 tables.

| **[An End-to-End Differentiable, Graph Neural Network-Embedded Pore Network Model for Permeability Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13841v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of permeability in porous media is essential for modeling subsurface flow. While pure data-driven models offer computational efficiency, they often lack generalization across scales and do not incorporate explicit physical constraints. Pore network models (PNMs), on the other hand, are physics-based and efficient but rely on idealized geometric assumptions to estimate pore-scale hydraulic conductance, limiting their accuracy in complex structures. To overcome these limitations, we present an end-to-end differentiable hybrid framework that embeds a graph neural network (GNN) into a PNM. In this framework, the analytical formulas used for conductance calculations are replaced by GNN-based predictions derived from pore and throat features. The predicted conductances are then passed to the PNM solver for permeability computation. In this way, the model avoids the idealized geometric assumptions of PNM while preserving the physics-based flow calculations. The GNN is trained without requiring labeled conductance data, which can number in the thousands per pore network; instead, it learns conductance values by using a single scalar permeability as the training target. This is made possible by backpropagating gradients through both the GNN (via automatic differentiation) and the PNM solver (via a discrete adjoint method), enabling fully coupled, end-to-end training. The resulting model achieves high accuracy and generalizes well across different scales, outperforming both pure data-driven and traditional PNM approaches. Gradient-based sensitivity analysis further reveals physically consistent feature influences, enhancing model interpretability. This approach offers a scalable and physically informed framework for permeability prediction in complex porous media, reducing model uncertainty and improving accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint is also available at ESS Open Archive: https://essopenarchive.org/users/960205/articles/1329010</p></details> |
| **[GraphTorque: Torque-Driven Rewiring Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21422v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process, motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to improve representation learning in heterophilous graphs and enhance robustness against noisy graphs. Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque metric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the perturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate information from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to hierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation noise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both heterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[State Space Models over Directed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13735v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed graphs are ubiquitous across numerous domains, where the directionality of edges encodes critical causal dependencies. However, existing GNNs and graph Transformers tailored for directed graphs face two major challenges: (1) effectively capturing long-range causal dependencies derived from directed edges; (2) balancing accuracy and training efficiency when processing large-scale graph datasets. In recent years, state space models (SSMs) have achieved substantial progress in causal sequence tasks, and their variants designed for graphs have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining high efficiency across various graph learning benchmarks. However, existing graph state space models are exclusively designed for undirected graphs, which limits their performance in directed graph learning. To this end, we propose an innovative approach DirEgo2Token which sequentializes directed graphs via k-hop ego graphs. This marks the first systematic extension of state space models to the field of directed graph learning. Building upon this, we develop DirGraphSSM, a novel directed graph neural network architecture that implements state space models on directed graphs via the message-passing mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that DirGraphSSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on three representative directed graph learning tasks while attaining competitive performance on two additional tasks with 1.5$\times $ to 2$\times $ training speed improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>curre...</summary><p>currently undergoing review by IEEE Transactions on Big Data</p></details> |
| **[Property-Isometric Variational Autoencoders for Sequence Modeling and Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14287v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biological sequence design (DNA, RNA, or peptides) with desired functional properties has applications in discovering novel nanomaterials, biosensors, antimicrobial drugs, and beyond. One common challenge is the ability to optimize complex high-dimensional properties such as target emission spectra of DNA-mediated fluorescent nanoparticles, photo and chemical stability, and antimicrobial activity of peptides across target microbes. Existing models rely on simple binary labels (e.g., binding/non-binding) rather than high-dimensional complex properties. To address this gap, we propose a geometry-preserving variational autoencoder framework, called PrIVAE, which learns latent sequence embeddings that respect the geometry of their property space. Specifically, we model the property space as a high-dimensional manifold that can be locally approximated by a nearest neighbor graph, given an appropriately defined distance measure. We employ the property graph to guide the sequence latent representations using (1) graph neural network encoder layers and (2) an isometric regularizer. PrIVAE learns a property-organized latent space that enables rational design of new sequences with desired properties by employing the trained decoder. We evaluate the utility of our framework for two generative tasks: (1) design of DNA sequences that template fluorescent metal nanoclusters and (2) design of antimicrobial peptides. The trained models retain high reconstruction accuracy while organizing the latent space according to properties. Beyond in silico experiments, we also employ sampled sequences for wet lab design of DNA nanoclusters, resulting in up to 16.1-fold enrichment of rare-property nanoclusters compared to their abundance in training data, demonstrating the practical utility of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 figures, preprint</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Hate Detection Using Dual-Stream Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13515v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hateful videos present serious risks to online safety and real-world well-being, necessitating effective detection methods. Although multimodal classification approaches integrating information from several modalities outperform unimodal ones, they typically neglect that even minimal hateful content defines a video's category. Specifically, they generally treat all content uniformly, instead of emphasizing the hateful components. Additionally, existing multimodal methods cannot systematically capture structured information in videos, limiting the effectiveness of multimodal fusion. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal dual-stream graph neural network model. It constructs an instance graph by separating the given video into several instances to extract instance-level features. Then, a complementary weight graph assigns importance weights to these features, highlighting hateful instances. Importance weights and instance features are combined to generate video labels. Our model employs a graph-based framework to systematically model structured relationships within and across modalities. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that our model is state-of-the-art in hateful video classification and has strong explainability.

| **[JANUS: A Dual-Constraint Generative Framework for Stealthy Node Injection Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13266v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various applications, yet they are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks, particularly node injection attacks. The success of such attacks heavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original graph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness by relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental characteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local structures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework, called Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local level, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve geometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate structured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the generated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the semantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a sequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning agent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS framework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack effectiveness and stealthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Heterophilic Graphs: A Spectral Theory Perspective on the Impact of Self-Loops and Parallel Edges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13139v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph heterophily poses a formidable challenge to the performance of Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (MP-GNNs). The familiar low-pass filters like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) face performance degradation, which can be attributed to the blending of the messages from dissimilar neighboring nodes. The performance of the low-pass filters on heterophilic graphs still requires an in-depth analysis. In this context, we update the heterophilic graphs by adding a number of self-loops and parallel edges. We observe that eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian decrease and increase respectively by increasing the number of self-loops and parallel edges. We conduct several studies regarding the performance of GCN on various benchmark heterophilic networks by adding either self-loops or parallel edges. The studies reveal that the GCN exhibited either increasing or decreasing performance trends on adding self-loops and parallel edges. In light of the studies, we established connections between the graph spectra and the performance trends of the low-pass filters on the heterophilic graphs. The graph spectra characterize the essential intrinsic properties of the input graph like the presence of connected components, sparsity, average degree, cluster structures, etc. Our work is adept at seamlessly evaluating graph spectrum and properties by observing the performance trends of the low-pass filters without pursuing the costly eigenvalue decomposition. The theoretical foundations are also discussed to validate the impact of adding self-loops and parallel edges on the graph spectrum.</p></details> |  |

We study a \emph{coarse-to-fine curriculum} that accelerates convergence by first training on very coarse meshes and then progressively introducing medium and high resolutions (up to \(3\times10^5\) nodes). Unlike multiscale GNN architectures, the model itself is unchanged; only the fidelity of the training data varies over time. We achieve comparable generalization accuracy while reducing total wall-clock time by up to 50\%. Furthermore, on datasets where our model lacks the capacity to learn the underlying physics, using curriculum learning enables it to break through plateaus.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce second-order tensorial partial differential equations on graphs (SoTPDEG) and propose the first theoretically grounded framework for second-order continuous product graph neural networks (GNNs). Our method exploits the separability of cosine kernels in Cartesian product graphs to enable efficient spectral decomposition while preserving high-frequency components. We further provide rigorous over-smoothing and stability analysis under graph perturbations, establishing a solid theoretical foundation. Experimental results on spatiotemporal traffic forecasting illustrate the superiority over the compared methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |

Our approach integrates neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and neural processes into a unified model that captures uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure. We represent dynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent trajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context observations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over latent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and extrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic dynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto oscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK Biobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and disease classification capabilities. The model accurately reconstructs trajectories and extrapolates future cardiac cycles from a single observed cycle. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ACDC classification task (up to 99% accuracy), and detects atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank subjects with competitive performance (up to 67% accuracy). This work introduces a flexible approach for analyzing cardiac motion and offers a foundation for graph-based learning in structured biomedical spatiotemporal time-series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learn from Global Correlations: Enhancing Evolutionary Algorithm via Spectral GNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17629v4)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) simulate natural selection but have two main limitations: (1) they rarely update individuals based on global correlations, limiting comprehensive learning; (2) they struggle with balancing exploration and exploitation, where excessive exploitation causes premature convergence, and excessive exploration slows down the search. Moreover, EAs often depend on manual parameter settings, which can disrupt the exploration-exploitation balance. To address these issues, we propose Graph Neural Evolution (GNE), a novel EA framework. GNE represents the population as a graph, where nodes represent individuals, and edges capture their relationships, enabling global information usage. GNE utilizes spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) to decompose evolutionary signals into frequency components, applying a filtering function to fuse these components. High-frequency components capture diverse global information, while low-frequency ones capture more consistent information. This explicit frequency filtering strategy directly controls global-scale features through frequency components, overcoming the limitations of manual parameter settings and making the exploration-exploitation control more interpretable and manageable. Tests on nine benchmark functions (e.g., Sphere, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock) show that GNE outperforms classical (GA, DE, CMA-ES) and advanced algorithms (SDAES, RL-SHADE) under various conditions, including noise-corrupted and optimal solution deviation scenarios. GNE achieves solutions several orders of magnitude better (e.g., 3.07e-20 mean on Sphere vs. 1.51e-07).</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Explicit Multimodal Graph Modeling for Human-Object Interaction Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12554v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection, which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork \textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs. Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare classes.</p></details> |  |

However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Our index techniques exploit spatiotemporal structure to construct snapshots dynamically at runtime, significantly reducing memory overhead, while distributed-index-batching extends this approach by enabling scalable processing across multiple GPUs. Our techniques enable the first-ever training of an ST-GNN on the entire PeMS dataset without graph partitioning, reducing peak memory usage by up to 89% and achieving up to a 11.78x speedup over standard DDP with 128 GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the 2025 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis</p></details> |

Automated detection of MDD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and deep learning (DL) methods holds increasing promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention. Most existing methods employ either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations built from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex brain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision Transformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and Graph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for defining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and functional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are trained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches. Further, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional relationships, and guide GNN-based classification. Extensive experiments were conducted using the REST-meta-MDD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. With stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best model obtained 78.98% accuracy, 76.54% sensitivity, 81.58% specificity, 81.58% precision, and 78.98% F1-score. Further, atlas-based models consistently outperformed the cube-based approach, highlighting the importance of using domain-specific anatomical priors for MDD detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, it remains a prevailing challenge due to the stochastic nature of urban traffic and environmental factors. Better predictions require models capable of accommodating the traffic variability influenced by multiple dynamic and complex interdependent factors. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to address the stochasticity by leveraging adaptive adjacency matrices using log-normal distributions and Coefficient of Variation (CV) values to reflect real-world travel time variability. Additionally, weather factors such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation adjust edge weights and enable GNN to capture evolving spatio-temporal dependencies across traffic stations. This enhancement over the static adjacency matrix allows the model to adapt effectively to traffic stochasticity and changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, we utilize the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP) framework to provide reliable uncertainty quantification, achieving target coverage while maintaining acceptable prediction intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model, in comparison with baseline methods, showed better prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds. We, then, validate this method by constructing traffic scenarios in SUMO and applying Monte-Carlo simulation to derive a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under Test (VUT) to reflect real-world variability. The simulated mean travel time of the VUT falls within the intervals defined by INRIX historical data, verifying the model's robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted as a REGULAR PAPER in the Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems 2025</p></details> |
| **[Visualization and Analysis of the Loss Landscape in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11792v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful models for graph-structured data, with broad applications. However, the interplay between GNN parameter optimization, expressivity, and generalization remains poorly understood. We address this by introducing an efficient learnable dimensionality reduction method for visualizing GNN loss landscapes, and by analyzing the effects of over-smoothing, jumping knowledge, quantization, sparsification, and preconditioner on GNN optimization. Our learnable projection method surpasses the state-of-the-art PCA-based approach, enabling accurate reconstruction of high-dimensional parameters with lower memory usage. We further show that architecture, sparsification, and optimizer's preconditioning significantly impact the GNN optimization landscape and their training process and final prediction performance. These insights contribute to developing more efficient designs of GNN architectures and training strategies.</p></details> |  |

Once the ICS is attacked, it may cause serious damage. Therefore, it is very important to detect anomalies in ICSs. ICS can monitor and manage physical devices remotely using communication networks. The existing anomaly detection approaches mainly focus on analyzing the security of network traffic or sensor data. However, the behaviors of different domains (e.g., network traffic and sensor physical status) of ICSs are correlated, so it is difficult to comprehensively identify anomalies by analyzing only a single domain. In this paper, an anomaly detection approach based on cross-domain representation learning in ICSs is proposed, which can learn the joint features of multi-domain behaviors and detect anomalies within different domains. After constructing a cross-domain graph that can represent the behaviors of multiple domains in ICSs, our approach can learn the joint features of them by leveraging graph neural networks. Since anomalies behave differently in different domains, we leverage a multi-task learning approach to identify anomalies in different domains separately and perform joint training. The experimental results show that the performance of our approach is better than existing approaches for identifying anomalies in ICSs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Regression for Enzyme Turnover Rates Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11782v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The enzyme turnover rate is a fundamental parameter in enzyme kinetics, reflecting the catalytic efficiency of enzymes. However, enzyme turnover rates remain scarce across most organisms due to the high cost and complexity of experimental measurements. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal framework for predicting the enzyme turnover rate by integrating enzyme sequences, substrate structures, and environmental factors. Our model combines a pre-trained language model and a convolutional neural network to extract features from protein sequences, while a graph neural network captures informative representations from substrate molecules. An attention mechanism is incorporated to enhance interactions between enzyme and substrate representations. Furthermore, we leverage symbolic regression via Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to explicitly learn mathematical formulas that govern the enzyme turnover rate, enabling interpretable and accurate predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. This work provides a robust tool for studying enzyme kinetics and holds promise for applications in enzyme engineering, biotechnology, and industrial biocatalysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Efficient Environmental Claim Detection with Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13628v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer based models, specially large language models (LLMs) dominate the field of NLP with their mass adoption in tasks such as text generation, summarization and fake news detection. These models offer ease of deployment and reliability for most applications, however, they require significant amounts of computational power for training as well as inference. This poses challenges in their adoption in resource-constrained applications, specially in the open-source community where compute availability is usually scarce. This work proposes a graph-based approach for Environmental Claim Detection, exploring Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) as lightweight yet effective alternatives to transformer-based models. Re-framing the task as a graph classification problem, we transform claim sentences into dependency parsing graphs, utilizing a combination of word2vec \& learnable part-of-speech (POS) tag embeddings for the node features and encoding syntactic dependencies in the edge relations. Our results show that our graph-based models, particularly HGNNs in the poincar\'e space (P-HGNNs), achieve performance superior to the state-of-the-art on environmental claim detection while using upto \textbf{30x fewer parameters}. We also demonstrate that HGNNs benefit vastly from explicitly modeling data in hierarchical (tree-like) structures, enabling them to significantly improve over their euclidean counterparts.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose Graph Lingual Network (GLN), a GNN built on large language models (LLMs), with hidden representations in the form of human-readable text. Through careful prompt design, GLN incorporates not only the message passing module of GNNs but also advanced GNN techniques, including graph attention and initial residual connection. The comprehensibility of GLN's hidden representations enables an intuitive analysis of how node representations change (1) across layers and (2) under advanced GNN techniques, shedding light on the inner workings of GNNs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GLN achieves strong zero-shot performance on node classification and link prediction, outperforming existing LLM-based baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at EMNLP 2025 Findings.

Modern machine learning has enabled the identification of complex biochemical intricacies in candidate drugs; however, many studies rely on simplified datasets with known drug-disease similarities. We propose a machine learning pipeline that uses unsupervised deep embedded clustering, combined with supervised graph neural network link prediction to identify new drug-disease links from multi-omic data. Unsupervised autoencoder and cluster training reduced the dimensionality of omic data into a compressed latent embedding. A total of 9,022 unique drugs were partitioned into 35 clusters with a mean silhouette score of 0.8550. Graph neural networks achieved strong statistical performance, with a prediction accuracy of 0.901, receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.960, and F1-Score of 0.901. A ranked list comprised of 477 per-cluster link probabilities exceeding 99 percent was generated. This study could provide new drug-disease link prospects across unrelated disease domains, while advancing the understanding of machine learning in drug repurposing studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)</p></details> |
| **[Topology-Aware and Highly Generalizable Deep Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Retrieval in Multi-Deep Storage Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14787v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of multi-deep storage systems. In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in optimizing retrieval tardiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Graph Attention Networks: Trainable Quantum Encoders for Inductive Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11390v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Quantum Graph Attention Networks (QGATs) as trainable quantum encoders for inductive learning on graphs, extending the Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNN) framework. QGATs leverage parameterized quantum circuits to encode node features and neighborhood structures, with quantum attention mechanisms modulating the contribution of each neighbor via dynamically learned unitaries. This allows for expressive, locality-aware quantum representations that can generalize across unseen graph instances. We evaluate our approach on the QM9 dataset, targeting the prediction of various chemical properties. Our experiments compare classical and quantum graph neural networks-with and without attention layers-demonstrating that attention consistently improves performance in both paradigms. Notably, we observe that quantum attention yields increasing benefits as graph size grows, with QGATs significantly outperforming their non-attentive quantum counterparts on larger molecular graphs. Furthermore, for smaller graphs, QGATs achieve predictive accuracy comparable to classical GAT models, highlighting their viability as expressive quantum encoders. These results show the potential of quantum attention mechanisms to enhance the inductive capacity of QGNN in chemistry and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRoC: Context Refactoring Contrast for Graph Anomaly Detection with Limited Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12278v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used as the engine for various graph-related tasks, with their effectiveness in analyzing graph-structured data. However, training robust GNNs often demands abundant labeled data, which is a critical bottleneck in real-world applications. This limitation severely impedes progress in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD), where anomalies are inherently rare, costly to label, and may actively camouflage their patterns to evade detection. To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring Contrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by jointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from previous works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor the context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the attributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore, CRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the message-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex interaction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while encouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover intricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated with the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness unlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative node embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRoC achieves up to 14% AUC improvement over baseline GNNs and outperforms state-of-the-art GAD methods under limited-label settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECAI 2025</p></details> |

Therefore, this study develops the first large-scale graph neural network (GNN), BIGNet, to learn, and reuse multidimensional design features embedded in BIM models. Firstly, a scalable graph representation is introduced to encode the "semantic-spatial-topological" features of BIM components, and a dataset with nearly 1 million nodes and 3.5 million edges is created. Subsequently, BIGNet is proposed by introducing a new message-passing mechanism to GraphMAE2 and further pretrained with a node masking strategy. Finally, BIGNet is evaluated in various transfer learning tasks for BIM-based design checking. Results show that: 1) homogeneous graph representation outperforms heterogeneous graph in learning design features, 2) considering local spatial relationships in a 30 cm radius enhances performance, and 3) BIGNet with GAT (Graph Attention Network)-based feature extraction achieves the best transfer learning results. This innovation leads to a 72.7% improvement in Average F1-score over non-pretrained models, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning and transferring BIM design features and facilitating their automated application in future design and lifecycle management.</p></details> |  |

Experiments demonstrated that MT-DQN consistently outperforms traditional concatenated models, such as Concat-Modal, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 10.97% and an average NDCG@5 improvement of 8.3%. Compared to the classic reinforcement learning model Vanilla-DQN, MT-DQN reduces MSE by 34.8% and MAE by 26.5%. Nonetheless, we also recognize challenges in deploying MT-DQN in real-world scenarios, such as its computational cost and latency sensitivity during online inference, which will be addressed through future architectural optimization.</p></details> | 26 pages |

However, current methods, mainly based on graph neural networks (GNNs), focus solely on structural and topological properties, neglecting cognitive traits. To address this, we introduce the first cognified generative model, CogGNN, which endows GNNs with cognitive capabilities (e.g., visual memory) to generate brain networks that preserve cognitive features. While broadly applicable, we present CogGNN, a specific variant designed to integrate visual input, a key factor in brain functions like pattern recognition and memory recall. As a proof of concept, we use our model to learn connectional brain templates (CBTs), population-level fingerprints from multi-view brain networks. Unlike prior work that overlooks cognitive properties, CogGNN generates CBTs that are both cognitively and structurally meaningful. Our contributions are: (i) a novel cognition-aware generative model with a visual-memory-based loss; (ii) a CBT-learning framework with a co-optimization strategy to yield well-centered, discriminative, cognitively enhanced templates. Extensive experiments show that CogGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a strong foundation for cognitively grounded brain network modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[M4GN: Mesh-based Multi-segment Hierarchical Graph Network for Dynamic Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10659v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mesh-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have become effective surrogates for PDE simulations, yet their deep message passing incurs high cost and over-smoothing on large, long-range meshes; hierarchical GNNs shorten propagation paths but still face two key obstacles: (i) building coarse graphs that respect mesh topology, geometry, and physical discontinuities, and (ii) maintaining fine-scale accuracy without sacrificing the speed gained from coarsening. We tackle these challenges with M4GN, a three-tier, segment-centric hierarchical network. M4GN begins with a hybrid segmentation strategy that pairs a fast graph partitioner with a superpixel-style refinement guided by modal-decomposition features, producing contiguous segments of dynamically consistent nodes. These segments are encoded by a permutation-invariant aggregator, avoiding the order sensitivity and quadratic cost of aggregation approaches used in prior works. The resulting information bridges a micro-level GNN, which captures local dynamics, and a macro-level transformer that reasons efficiently across segments, achieving a principled balance between accuracy and efficiency. Evaluated on multiple representative benchmark datasets, M4GN improves prediction accuracy by up to 56% while achieving up to 22% faster inference than state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Sheaf Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09590v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equipping graph neural networks with a convolution operation defined in terms of a cellular sheaf offers advantages for learning expressive representations of heterophilic graph data. The most flexible approach to constructing the sheaf is to learn it as part of the network as a function of the node features. However, this leaves the network potentially overly sensitive to the learned sheaf. As a counter-measure, we propose a variational approach to learning cellular sheaves within sheaf neural networks, yielding an architecture we refer to as a Bayesian sheaf neural network. As part of this work, we define a novel family of reparameterizable probability distributions on the rotation group $SO(n)$ using the Cayley transform. We evaluate the Bayesian sheaf neural network on several graph datasets, and show that our Bayesian sheaf models achieve leading performance compared to baseline models and are less sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters under limited training data settings.</p></details> | 32 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Spatial Modeling and Risk Zoning of Global Extreme Precipitation via Graph Neural Networks and r-Pareto Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10362v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme precipitation events occurring over large spatial domains pose substantial threats to societies because they can trigger compound flooding, landslides, and infrastructure failures across wide areas. A hybrid framework for spatial extreme precipitation modeling and risk zoning is proposed that integrates graph neural networks with r-Pareto processes (GNN-rP). Unlike traditional statistical spatial extremes models, this approach learns nonlinear, nonstationary dependence structures from precipitation-derived spatial graphs and applies a data-driven tail functional to model joint exceedances in a low-dimensional embedding space. Using NASA's IMERG observations (2000-2021) and CMIP6 SSP5-8.5 projections, the framework delineates coherent high-risk zones, quantifies their temporal persistence, and detects emerging hotspots under climate change. Compared with two baseline approaches, the GNN-rP pipeline substantially improves pointwise detection of high-risk grid cells while yielding comparable clustering stability. Results highlight persistent high-risk regions in the tropical belt, especially monsoon and convective zones, and reveal decadal-scale persistence that is punctuated by episodic reconfigurations under high-emission scenarios. By coupling machine learning with extreme value theory, GNN-rP offers a scalable, interpretable tool for adaptive climate risk zoning, with direct applications in infrastructure planning, disaster preparedness, and climate-resilient policy design.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Why does your graph neural network fail on some graphs? Insights from exact generalisation error](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10337v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used in learning on graph-structured data, yet a principled understanding of why they succeed or fail remains elusive. While prior works have examined architectural limitations such as over-smoothing and over-squashing, these do not explain what enables GNNs to extract meaningful representations or why performance varies drastically between similar architectures. These questions are related to the role of generalisation: the ability of a model to make accurate predictions on unlabelled data. Although several works have derived generalisation error bounds for GNNs, these are typically loose, restricted to a single architecture, and offer limited insight into what governs generalisation in practice. In this work, we take a different approach by deriving the exact generalisation error for GNNs in a transductive fixed-design setting through the lens of signal processing. From this viewpoint, GNNs can be interpreted as graph filter operators that act on node features via the graph structure. By focusing on linear GNNs while allowing non-linearity in the graph filters, we derive the first exact generalisation error for a broad range of GNNs, including convolutional, PageRank-based, and attention-based models. The exact characterisation of the generalisation error reveals that only the aligned information between node features and graph structure contributes to generalisation. Furthermore, we quantify the effect of homophily on generalisation. Our work provides a framework that explains when and why GNNs can effectively leverage structural and feature information, offering practical guidance for model selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Modeling in Graph Neural Networks via Stochastic Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16115v5)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) framework to address the problem of learning uncertainty-aware representations for graph-structured data. While Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (GNODEs) have shown promise in learning node representations, they lack the ability to quantify uncertainty. To address this, we introduce Latent Graph Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (LGNSDE), which enhance GNODE by embedding randomness through a Bayesian prior-posterior mechanism for epistemic uncertainty and Brownian motion for aleatoric uncertainty. By leveraging the existence and uniqueness of solutions to graph-based SDEs, we prove that the variance of the latent space bounds the variance of model outputs, thereby providing theoretically sensible guarantees for the uncertainty estimates. Furthermore, we show mathematically that LGNSDEs are robust to small perturbations in the input, maintaining stability over time. Empirical results across several benchmarks demonstrate that our framework is competitive in out-of-distribution detection, robustness to noise, and active learning, underscoring the ability of LGNSDEs to quantify uncertainty reliably.

| **[Representation Learning on Large Non-Bipartite Transaction Networks using GraphSAGE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12255v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial institutions increasingly require scalable tools to analyse complex transactional networks, yet traditional graph embedding methods struggle with dynamic, real-world banking data. This paper demonstrates the practical application of GraphSAGE, an inductive Graph Neural Network framework, to non-bipartite heterogeneous transaction networks within a banking context. Unlike transductive approaches, GraphSAGE scales well to large networks and can generalise to unseen nodes which is critical for institutions working with temporally evolving transactional data. We construct a transaction network using anonymised customer and merchant transactions and train a GraphSAGE model to generate node embeddings. Our exploratory work on the embeddings reveals interpretable clusters aligned with geographic and demographic attributes. Additionally, we illustrate their utility in downstream classification tasks by applying them to a money mule detection model where using these embeddings improves the prioritisation of high-risk accounts. Beyond fraud detection, our work highlights the adaptability of this framework to banking-scale networks, emphasising its inductive capability, scalability, and interpretability. This study provides a blueprint for financial organisations to harness graph machine learning for actionable insights in transactional ecosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximate Graph Propagation Revisited: Dynamic Parameterized Queries, Tighter Bounds and Dynamic Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10036v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit Approximate Graph Propagation (AGP), a unified framework which captures various graph propagation tasks, such as PageRank, feature propagation in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our work focuses on the settings of dynamic graphs and dynamic parameterized queries, where the underlying graphs evolve over time (updated by edge insertions or deletions) and the input query parameters are specified on the fly to fit application needs. Our first contribution is an interesting observation that the SOTA solution, AGP-Static, can be adapted to support dynamic parameterized queries; however several challenges remain unresolved. Firstly, the query time complexity of AGP-Static is based on an assumption of using an optimal algorithm for subset sampling in its query algorithm. Unfortunately, back to that time, such an algorithm did not exist; without such an optimal algorithm, an extra $O(\log^2 n)$ factor is required in the query complexity, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graphs. Secondly, AGP-Static performs poorly on dynamic graphs, taking $O(n\log n)$ time to process each update. To address these challenges, we propose a new algorithm, AGP-Static++, which is simpler yet reduces roughly a factor of $O(\log^2 n)$ in the query complexity while preserving the approximation guarantees of AGP-Static. However, AGP-Static++ still requires $O(n)$ time to process each update. To better support dynamic graphs, we further propose AGP-Dynamic, which achieves $O(1)$ amortized time per update, significantly improving the aforementioned $O(n)$ per-update bound, while still preserving the query complexity and approximation guarantees. Last, our comprehensive experiments validate the theoretical improvements: compared to the baselines, our algorithm achieves speedups of up to $177\times$ on update time and $10\times$ on query efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Atherosclerosis through Hierarchical Explainable Neural Network Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07373v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient: clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI (XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their clinical actionable outcomes.</p></details> |  |

We argue that the heterogeneity in node types, nodal features, and local neighborhood topology poses significant challenges for ensemble learning, particularly in accommodating diverse graph learners. Our HGEN framework ensembles multiple learners through a meta-path and transformation-based optimization pipeline to uplift classification accuracy. Specifically, HGEN uses meta-path combined with random dropping to create Allele Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), whereby the base graph learners are trained and aligned for later ensembling. To ensure effective ensemble learning, HGEN presents two key components: 1) a residual-attention mechanism to calibrate allele GNNs of different meta-paths, thereby enforcing node embeddings to focus on more informative graphs to improve base learner accuracy, and 2) a correlation-regularization term to enlarge the disparity among embedding matrices generated from different meta-paths, thereby enriching base learner diversity. We analyze the convergence of HGEN and attest its higher regularization magnitude over simple voting. Experiments on five heterogeneous networks validate that HGEN consistently outperforms its state-of-the-art competitors by substantial margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is in proceedings of the 34th IJCAI Conference, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Explainable Job Title Matching: Leveraging Semantic Textual Relatedness and Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09522v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) captures nuanced relationships between texts that extend beyond superficial lexical similarity. In this study, we investigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in resume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or misleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that evaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data stratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions: low, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables a fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful subspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG integration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT models augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR region, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings highlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also the importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model behavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by global metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human Resources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and contextual matching are essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Database Views as Explanations for Relational Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09482v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of deep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based on heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph transformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and links (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical expression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it hard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available data to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for explaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where explanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database that mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global abductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash, Segoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between determinacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of granularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones highlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of tuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case of hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive search over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are model-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of learnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical study on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different record-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed explanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation.</p></details> |  |

Recent efforts have attempted to enhance structural expressiveness by integrating random walk kernels into GNNs. However, these methods are inherently designed for graph-level tasks, which limits their applicability to other downstream tasks such as node classification. Moreover, their fixed kernel configurations hinder the model's flexibility in capturing diverse subgraph structures. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts (MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. We further provide a theoretical analysis of MoSE's expressivity within the Subgraph Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) Test, proving that it is more powerful than SWL. Extensive experiments, together with visualizations of learned subgraph experts, demonstrate that MoSE not only outperforms competitive baselines but also provides interpretable insights into structural patterns learned by the model.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL, with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score. Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Graph Neural Networks for Robustness in Olfaction Sensors and Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00455v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic odour source localization (OSL) is a critical capability for autonomous systems operating in complex environments. However, current OSL methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation to enhance odour localization accuracy that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines. This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and training methods, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors, enabling them to detect more compounds and inform better hardware design. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making through better sensor selection for a target compound in critical applications such as explosives detection, narcotics screening, and search and rescue. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of artificial olfaction, offering a scalable solution to challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities.

The main novelty of CryptGNN is its secure message passing and feature transformation layers using distributed secure multi-party computation (SMPC) techniques. CryptGNN protects the client's input data and graph structure from the cloud provider and the third-party model owner, and it protects the model parameters from the cloud provider and the clients. CryptGNN works with any number of SMPC parties, does not require a trusted server, and is provably secure even if P-1 out of P parties in the cloud collude. Theoretical analysis and empirical experiments demonstrate the security and efficiency of CryptGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Inventory Networks: Toward Reliable Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11246v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We argue that inventory management presents unique opportunities for the reliable application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). To enable this, we emphasize and test two complementary techniques. The first is Hindsight Differentiable Policy Optimization (HDPO), which uses pathwise gradients from offline counterfactual simulations to directly and efficiently optimize policy performance. Unlike standard policy gradient methods that rely on high-variance score-function estimators, HDPO computes gradients by differentiating through the known system dynamics. Via extensive benchmarking, we show that HDPO recovers near-optimal policies in settings with known or bounded optima, is more robust than variants of the REINFORCE algorithm, and significantly outperforms generalized newsvendor heuristics on problems using real time series data. Our second technique aligns neural policy architectures with the topology of the inventory network. We exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a natural inductive bias for encoding supply chain structure, demonstrate that they can represent optimal and near-optimal policies in two theoretical settings, and empirically show that they reduce data requirements across six diverse inventory problems. A key obstacle to progress in this area is the lack of standardized benchmark problems. To address this gap, we open-source a suite of benchmark environments, along with our full codebase, to promote transparency and reproducibility.

| **[Assessing the Limits of Graph Neural Networks for Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium Prediction: A Cryogenic Mixture Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10565v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and fast thermophysical models are needed to embed vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) calculations in design, optimization, and control loops for cryogenic mixtures. This study asks whether a structure-aware graph neural network (GNN; DimeNet++) trained on GERG-2008/CoolProp data can act as a practical surrogate for an equation of state (EoS). We generate a ternary dataset over 90-200 K and pressures to 100 bar, curate it with a 15% density filter (reducing 5,200 states to 1,516), and pair each state with a lightweight molecular-dynamics snapshot to supply structural features. The model is trained in two stages; pretraining on residual Helmholtz energy followed by pressure fine-tuning with a stability penalty; and evaluated via single-phase interpolation tests, solver-free derivative-quality diagnostics, an audited VLE driver, and a latency benchmark. Within its regime, the GNN interpolates single-phase properties reasonably well; however, the VLE driver accepts no GNN equilibria on tested binaries (all plotted VLE points are CoolProp fallback or the solver fails), and diagnostic probes reveal jagged P(V|T) paths and thermal-stability flags concentrated in dense/cold regions, indicating insufficient derivative smoothness/consistency for robust equilibrium solving. An end-to-end timing comparison shows no single-phase speed advantage relative to CoolProp (tens of milliseconds vs sub-millisecond). We conclude that, as configured, the surrogate in this study is not solver-ready for VLE and offers no runtime benefit; its value is methodological, delineating failure modes and pointing to remedies such as physics-informed training signals and targeted coverage near phase boundaries.</p></details> |  |

Our approach encodes complex quantum network dynamics, including entanglement degradation and time-varying channel noise, into a low-dimensional feature space, enabling efficient belief updates and scalable policy learning. The core of our framework is a hybrid GNN-POMDP architecture that processes graph-structured representations of entangled links to learn routing policies, coupled with a noise-adaptive mechanism that fuses POMDP belief updates with GNN outputs for robust decision making. We provide a theoretical analysis establishing guarantees for belief convergence, policy improvement, and robustness to noise. Experiments on simulated quantum networks with up to 100 nodes demonstrate significant improvements in routing fidelity and entanglement delivery rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under high decoherence and nonstationary conditions.</p></details> |  |

Machine learning (ML) potentials that predict energies from crystal structures are promising, but existing methods face computational bottlenecks. Steerable graph neural networks (GNNs) encode geometry with spherical harmonics, respecting atomic symmetries -- permutation, rotation, and translation -- for physically realistic predictions. Yet maintaining equivariance is difficult: activation functions must be modified, and each layer must handle multiple data types for different harmonic orders. We present Facet, a GNN architecture for efficient ML potentials, developed through systematic analysis of steerable GNNs. Our innovations include replacing expensive multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for interatomic distances with splines, which match performance while cutting computational and memory demands. We also introduce a general-purpose equivariant layer that mixes node information via spherical grid projection followed by standard MLPs -- faster than tensor products and more expressive than linear or gate layers. On the MPTrj dataset, Facet matches leading models with far fewer parameters and under 10% of their training compute. On a crystal relaxation task, it runs twice as fast as MACE models. We further show SevenNet-0's parameters can be reduced by over 25% with no accuracy loss. These techniques enable more than 10x faster training of large-scale foundation models for ML potentials, potentially reshaping computational materials discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTS_Forecaster: a novel deep learning based geodetic time series forecasting toolbox with python](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10560v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geodetic time series -- such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positions, satellite altimetry-derived sea surface height (SSH), and tide gauge (TG) records -- is essential for monitoring surface deformation and sea level change. Accurate forecasts of these variables can enhance early warning systems and support hazard mitigation for earthquakes, landslides, coastal storm surge, and long-term sea level. However, the nonlinear, non-stationary, and incomplete nature of such variables presents significant challenges for classic models, which often fail to capture long-term dependencies and complex spatiotemporal dynamics. We introduce GTS Forecaster, an open-source Python package for geodetic time series forecasting. It integrates advanced deep learning models -- including kernel attention networks (KAN), graph neural network-based gated recurrent units (GNNGRU), and time-aware graph neural networks (TimeGNN) -- to effectively model nonlinear spatial-temporal patterns. The package also provides robust preprocessing tools, including outlier detection and a reinforcement learning-based gap-filling algorithm, the Kalman-TransFusion Interpolation Framework (KTIF). GTS Forecaster currently supports forecasting, visualization, and evaluation of GNSS, SSH, and TG datasets, and is adaptable to general time series applications. By combining cutting-edge models with an accessible interface, it facilitates the application of deep learning in geodetic forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Robustness of Link Sign Prediction in Signed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10590v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signed graphs serve as fundamental data structures for representing positive and negative relationships in social networks, with signed graph neural networks (SGNNs) emerging as the primary tool for their analysis. Our investigation reveals that balance theory, while essential for modeling signed relationships in SGNNs, inadvertently introduces exploitable vulnerabilities to black-box attacks. To showcase this, we propose balance-attack, a novel adversarial strategy specifically designed to compromise graph balance degree, and develop an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve the associated NP-hard optimization problem. While existing approaches attempt to restore attacked graphs through balance learning techniques, they face a critical challenge we term "Irreversibility of Balance-related Information," as restored edges fail to align with original attack targets. To address this limitation, we introduce Balance Augmented-Signed Graph Contrastive Learning (BA-SGCL), an innovative framework that combines contrastive learning with balance augmentation techniques to achieve robust graph representations. By maintaining high balance degree in the latent space, BA-SGCL not only effectively circumvents the irreversibility challenge but also significantly enhances model resilience. Extensive experiments across multiple SGNN architectures and real-world datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness of our proposed balance-attack and the superior robustness of BA-SGCL, advancing the security and reliability of signed graph analysis in social networks. Datasets and codes of the proposed framework are at the github repository https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BA-SGCL-submit-DF41/.</p></details> |  |
| **[MSRFormer: Road Network Representation Learning using Multi-scale Feature Fusion of Heterogeneous Spatial Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05685v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer, MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections, which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow heterogeneity of spatial interactions.</p></details> |  |

| **[Safeguarding Graph Neural Networks against Topology Inference Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05429v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning from graph-structured data. However, their widespread adoption has raised serious privacy concerns. While prior research has primarily focused on edge-level privacy, a critical yet underexplored threat lies in topology privacy - the confidentiality of the graph's overall structure. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on topology privacy risks in GNNs, revealing their vulnerability to graph-level inference attacks. To this end, we propose a suite of Topology Inference Attacks (TIAs) that can reconstruct the structure of a target training graph using only black-box access to a GNN model. Our findings show that GNNs are highly susceptible to these attacks, and that existing edge-level differential privacy mechanisms are insufficient as they either fail to mitigate the risk or severely compromise model accuracy. To address this challenge, we introduce Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR), a novel defense framework designed to protect topology privacy while maintaining model accuracy. PGR is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, where a synthetic training graph is iteratively generated using meta-gradients, and the GNN model is concurrently updated based on the evolving graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PGR significantly reduces topology leakage with minimal impact on model accuracy.

While GinAR addresses variable missing using attention-based imputation and adaptive graph learning for the first time, it lacks interpretability and fails to capture more latent temporal patterns due to its simple recursive units (RUs). To overcome these limitations, we propose the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN), integrating Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) and Gaussian kernel-based Graph Convolution (GGCN). IBN estimates the uncertainty of reconstructed values using MC Dropout and applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to mitigate high-risk reconstructions. GGCN explicitly models spatial correlations among variables, while a bidirectional RU enhances temporal dependency modeling. Extensive experiments show that IBN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing a more reliable and interpretable framework for MTSF with missing variables.

However, the coexistence of distinct vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) connectivity requirements, together with highly dynamic and heterogeneous network topologies, presents significant challenges for unified reliability modeling and resource optimization. To address these issues, we propose VariSAC, a graph neural network (GNN)-augmented deep reinforcement learning framework for assured, time-continuous connectivity in RIS-assisted, ISAC-enabled vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems. Specifically, we introduce the Continuous Connectivity Ratio (CCR), a unified metric that characterizes the sustained temporal reliability of V2I connections and the probabilistic delivery guarantees of V2V links, thus unifying their continuous reliability semantics. Next, we employ a GNN with residual adapters to encode complex, high-dimensional system states, capturing spatial dependencies among vehicles, base stations (BS), and RIS nodes. These representations are then processed by a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agent, which jointly optimizes channel allocation, power control, and RIS configurations to maximize CCR-driven long-term rewards. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets demonstrate that VariSAC consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of continuous V2I ISAC connectivity and V2V delivery reliability, enabling persistent connectivity in highly dynamic vehicular environments.</p></details> |  |

However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible framework for neural-symbolic integration.</p></details> |  |

However, the classical NL models are restricted by their limited representation capability and handcrafted utility specification. While researchers introduced deep neural networks (DNNs) to tackle such challenges, the existing DNNs cannot explicitly capture inter-alternative correlations in the discrete choice context. To address the challenges, this study proposes a novel concept - alternative graph - to represent the relationships among travel mode alternatives. Using a nested alternative graph, this study further designs a nested-utility graph neural network (NestGNN) as a generalization of the classical NL model in the neural network family. Theoretically, NestGNNs generalize the classical NL models and existing DNNs in terms of model representation, while retaining the crucial two-layer substitution patterns of the NL models: proportional substitution within a nest but non-proportional substitution beyond a nest. Empirically, we find that the NestGNNs significantly outperform the benchmark models, particularly the corresponding NL models by 9.2\%. As shown by elasticity tables and substitution visualization, NestGNNs retain the two-layer substitution patterns as the NL model, and yet presents more flexibility in its model design space. Overall, our study demonstrates the power of NestGNN in prediction, interpretation, and its flexibility of generalizing the classical NL model for analyzing travel mode choice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous Message Passing for Addressing Oversquashing in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06777v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from Oversquashing, which occurs when tasks require long-range interactions. The problem arises from the presence of bottlenecks that limit the propagation of messages among distant nodes. Recently, graph rewiring methods modify edge connectivity and are expected to perform well on long-range tasks. Yet, graph rewiring compromises the inductive bias, incurring significant information loss in solving the downstream task. Furthermore, increasing channel capacity may overcome information bottlenecks but enhance the parameter complexity of the model. To alleviate these shortcomings, we propose an efficient model-agnostic framework that asynchronously updates node features, unlike traditional synchronous message passing GNNs. Our framework creates node batches in every layer based on the node centrality values. The features of the nodes belonging to these batches will only get updated. Asynchronous message updates process information sequentially across layers, avoiding simultaneous compression into fixed-capacity channels. We also theoretically establish that our proposed framework maintains higher feature sensitivity bounds compared to standard synchronous approaches. Our framework is applied to six standard graph datasets and two long-range datasets to perform graph classification and achieves impressive performances with a $5\%$ and $4\%$ improvements on REDDIT-BINARY and Peptides-struct, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, systematic biases often persist, making statistical post-processing essential. Traditional parametric post-processing techniques and machine learning-based methods can produce calibrated predictive distributions at specific locations and lead times, yet often struggle to capture dependencies across forecast dimensions. To address this, multivariate post-processing methods-such as ensemble copula coupling and the Schaake shuffle-are widely applied in a second step to restore realistic inter-variable or spatio-temporal dependencies. The aim of this study is the multivariate post-processing of ensemble forecasts using a graph neural network (dualGNN) trained with a composite loss function that combines the energy score (ES) and the variogram score (VS). The method is evaluated on two datasets: WRF-based solar irradiance forecasts over northern Chile and ECMWF visibility forecasts for Central Europe. The dualGNN consistently outperforms all empirical copula-based post-processed forecasts and shows significant improvements compared to graph neural networks trained solely on either the continuous ranked probability score or the ES, according to the evaluated multivariate verification metrics. Furthermore, for the WRF forecasts, the rank-order structure of the dualGNN forecasts captures valuable dependency information, enabling a more effective restoration of spatial relationships than either the raw numerical weather prediction ensemble or historical observational rank structures. Notably, incorporating VS into the loss function improved the univariate performance for both target variables compared to training on ES alone. Moreover, for the visibility forecasts, the ES-VS combination even outperformed the strongest calibrated reference in terms of univariate performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 16 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range interactions are captured through a flexible spectral domain parameterization. This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Load Balancing with GNN in MPTCP-Enabled Heterogeneous Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17118v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks are a promising paradigm of heterogeneous network (HetNet), attributed to the complementary physical properties of optical spectra and radio frequency. However, the current development of such HetNets is mostly bottlenecked by the existing transmission control protocol (TCP), which restricts the user equipment (UE) to connecting one access point (AP) at a time. While the ongoing investigation on multipath TCP (MPTCP) can bring significant benefits, it complicates the network topology of HetNets, making the existing load balancing (LB) learning models less effective. Driven by this, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based model to tackle the LB problem for MPTCP-enabled HetNets, which results in a partial mesh topology. Such a topology can be modeled as a graph, with the channel state information and data rate requirement embedded as node features, while the LB solutions are deemed as edge labels. Compared to the conventional deep neural network (DNN), the proposed GNN-based model exhibits two key strengths: i) it can better interpret a complex network topology; and ii) it can handle various numbers of APs and UEs with a single trained model. Simulation results show that against the traditional optimisation method, the proposed learning model can achieve near-optimal throughput within a gap of 11.5%, while reducing the inference time by 4 orders of magnitude. In contrast to the DNN model, the new method can improve the network throughput by up to 21.7%, at a similar inference time level.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wo...</summary><p>We would like to withdraw this submission because it contains several errors that need substantial revision.

| **[PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bounds for Graph Convolutional Networks on Inductive Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06600v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in processing graph-structured data across various applications. A critical aspect of real-world graphs is their dynamic nature, where new nodes are continually added and existing connections may change over time. Previous theoretical studies, largely based on the transductive learning framework, fail to adequately model such temporal evolution and structural dynamics. In this paper, we presents a PAC-Bayesian theoretical analysis of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for inductive node classification, treating nodes as dependent and non-identically distributed data points. We derive novel generalization bounds for one-layer GCNs that explicitly incorporate the effects of data dependency and non-stationarity, and establish sufficient conditions under which the generalization gap converges to zero as the number of nodes increases. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to two-layer GCNs, and reveal that it requires stronger assumptions on graph topology to guarantee convergence. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding and improving GNN generalization in dynamic graph environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topological Regularization for Force Prediction in Active Particle Suspension with EGNN and Persistent Homology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06574v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capturing the dynamics of active particles, i.e., small self-propelled agents that both deform and are deformed by a fluid in which they move is a formidable problem as it requires coupling fine scale hydrodynamics with large scale collective effects. So we present a multi-scale framework that combines the three learning-driven tools to learn in concert within one pipeline. We use high-resolution Lattice Boltzmann snapshots of fluid velocity and particle stresses in a periodic box as input to the learning pipeline. the second step takes the morphology and positions orientations of particles to predict pairwise interaction forces between them with a E(2)-equivariant graph neural network that necessarily respect flat symmetries. Then, a physics-informed neural network further updates these local estimates by summing over them with a stress data using Fourier feature mappings and residual blocks that is additionally regularized with a topological term (introduced by persistent homology) to penalize unrealistically tangled or spurious connections. In concert, these stages deliver an holistic highly-data driven full force network prediction empathizing on the physical underpinnings together with emerging multi-scale structure typical for active matter.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking GNN Expressive Power from a Distributed Computational Model Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01308v4)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of graph neural networks (GNNs) has motivated theoretical studies on their expressive power, often through alignments with the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) tests. However, such analyses typically focus on the ability of GNNs to distinguish between graph structures, rather than to compute or approximate specific function classes. The latter is more commonly studied in machine learning theory, including results such as the Turing completeness of recurrent networks and the universal approximation property of feedforward networks. We argue that using well-defined computational models, such as a modified CONGEST model with clearly specified preprocessing and postprocessing, offers a more sound framework for analyzing GNN expressiveness. Within this framework, we show that allowing unrestricted preprocessing or incorporating externally computed features, while claiming that these precomputations enhance the expressiveness, can sometimes lead to problems. We also show that the lower bound on a GNN's capacity (depth multiplied by width) to simulate one iteration of the WL test actually grows nearly linearly with graph size, indicating that the WL test is not locally computable and is misaligned with message-passing GNNs. Despite these negative results, we also present positive results that characterize the effects of virtual nodes and edges from a computational model perspective. Finally, we highlight several open problems regarding GNN expressiveness for further exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Resource Allocation in Interference-limited Multi-Channel Wireless Networks with QoS Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06395v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meeting minimum data rate constraints is a significant challenge in wireless communication systems, particularly as network complexity grows. Traditional deep learning approaches often address these constraints by incorporating penalty terms into the loss function and tuning hyperparameters empirically. However, this heuristic treatment offers no theoretical convergence guarantees and frequently fails to satisfy QoS requirements in practical scenarios. Building upon the structure of the WMMSE algorithm, we first extend it to a multi-channel setting with QoS constraints, resulting in the enhanced WMMSE (eWMMSE) algorithm, which is provably convergent to a locally optimal solution when the problem is feasible. To further reduce computational complexity and improve scalability, we develop a GNN-based algorithm, JCPGNN-M, capable of supporting simultaneous multi-channel allocation per user. To overcome the limitations of traditional deep learning methods, we propose a principled framework that integrates GNN with a Lagrangian-based primal-dual optimization method. By training the GNN within the Lagrangian framework, we ensure satisfaction of QoS constraints and convergence to a stationary point. Extensive simulations demonstrate that JCPGNN-M matches the performance of eWMMSE while offering significant gains in inference speed, generalization to larger networks, and robustness under imperfect channel state information. This work presents a scalable and theoretically grounded solution for constrained resource allocation in future wireless networks.</p></details> |  |

This study investigates the application of graph neural network models to learn the behavior of a linear dynamical system on networks. A graph convolution and attention-based neural network framework has been developed to identify the steady-state behavior of the linear dynamical system. We reveal that our trained model distinguishes the different states with high accuracy. Furthermore, we have evaluated model performance with real-world data. In addition, to understand the explainability of our model, we provide an analytical derivation for the forward and backward propagation of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 15 figures (including Appendix)</p></details> |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks Approach for Predicting Silent Data Corruption inducing Circuit-Level Faults](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06289v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Silent Data Errors (SDEs) from time-zero defects and aging degrade safety-critical systems. Functional testing detects SDE-related faults but is expensive to simulate. We present a unified spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) for fast, accurate prediction of long-cycle fault impact probabilities (FIPs) in large sequential circuits, supporting quantitative risk assessment. Gate-level netlists are modeled as spatio-temporal graphs to capture topology and signal timing; dedicated spatial and temporal encoders predict multi-cycle FIPs efficiently. On ISCAS-89 benchmarks, the method reduces simulation time by more than 10x while maintaining high accuracy (mean absolute error 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions). The framework accepts features from testability metrics or fault simulation, allowing efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. A test-point selection study shows that choosing observation points by predicted FIPs improves detection of long-cycle, hard-to-detect faults. The approach scales to SoC-level test strategy optimization and fits downstream electronic design automation flows.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, plan to submit to ACM TODAES</p></details> |
| **[RecMind: LLM-Enhanced Graph Neural Networks for Personalized Consumer Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06286v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalization is a core capability across consumer technologies, streaming, shopping, wearables, and voice, yet it remains challenged by sparse interactions, fast content churn, and heterogeneous textual signals. We present RecMind, an LLM-enhanced graph recommender that treats the language model as a preference prior rather than a monolithic ranker. A frozen LLM equipped with lightweight adapters produces text-conditioned user/item embeddings from titles, attributes, and reviews; a LightGCN backbone learns collaborative embeddings from the user-item graph. We align the two views with a symmetric contrastive objective and fuse them via intra-layer gating, allowing language to dominate in cold/long-tail regimes and graph structure to stabilize rankings elsewhere. On Yelp and Amazon-Electronics, RecMind attains the best results on all eight reported metrics, with relative improvements up to +4.53\% (Recall@40) and +4.01\% (NDCG@40) over strong baselines. Ablations confirm both the necessity of cross-view alignment and the advantage of gating over late fusion and LLM-only variants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Efficient Time-Dependent PDE Surrogates: Graph Neural Simulators vs Neural Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06154v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operators (NOs) approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces but require large datasets and struggle with scarce training data. Many NO formulations don't explicitly encode causal, local-in-time structure of physical evolution. While autoregressive models preserve causality by predicting next time-steps, they suffer from rapid error accumulation. We employ Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) - a message-passing graph neural network framework - with explicit numerical time-stepping schemes to construct accurate forward models that learn PDE solutions by modeling instantaneous time derivatives. We evaluate our framework on three canonical PDE systems: (1) 2D Burgers' scalar equation, (2) 2D coupled Burgers' vector equation, and (3) 2D Allen-Cahn equation. Rigorous evaluations demonstrate GNS significantly improves data efficiency, achieving higher generalization accuracy with substantially fewer training trajectories compared to neural operator baselines like DeepONet and FNO. GNS consistently achieves under 1% relative L2 errors with only 30 training samples out of 1000 (3% of available data) across all three PDE systems. It substantially reduces error accumulation over extended temporal horizons: averaged across all cases, GNS reduces autoregressive error by 82.48% relative to FNO AR and 99.86% relative to DON AR. We introduce a PCA+KMeans trajectory selection strategy enhancing low-data performance. Results indicate combining graph-based local inductive biases with conventional time integrators yields accurate, physically consistent, and scalable surrogate models for time-dependent PDEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages including references.

| **[Multi-Stage Graph Neural Networks for Data-Driven Prediction of Natural Convection in Enclosed Cavities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06041v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data, particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy, improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRACE: Graph-Guided Repository-Aware Code Completion through Hierarchical Code Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05980v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs excel in localized code completion but struggle with repository-level tasks due to limited context windows and complex semantic and structural dependencies across codebases. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates context scarcity by retrieving relevant code snippets, current approaches face significant limitations. They overly rely on textual similarity for retrieval, neglecting structural relationships such as call chains and inheritance hierarchies, and lose critical structural information by naively concatenating retrieved snippets into text sequences for LLM input. To address these shortcomings, GRACE constructs a multi-level, multi-semantic code graph that unifies file structures, abstract syntax trees, function call graphs, class hierarchies, and data flow graphs to capture both static and dynamic code semantics. For retrieval, GRACE employs a Hybrid Graph Retriever that integrates graph neural network-based structural similarity with textual retrieval, refined by a graph attention network-based re-ranker to prioritize topologically relevant subgraphs. To enhance context, GRACE introduces a structural fusion mechanism that merges retrieved subgraphs with the local code context and preserves essential dependencies like function calls and inheritance. Extensive experiments on public repository-level benchmarks demonstrate that GRACE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all metrics. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the backbone LLM, GRACE surpasses the strongest graph-based RAG baselines by 8.19% EM and 7.51% ES points on every dataset.

However, the precise and efficient decoding of MI remains challenging due to their non-stationary nature and low signal-to-noise ratio. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end deep learning framework of Discriminative Residual Dense Convolutional Autoencoder with Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (DRDCAE-STGNN) to enhance the MI feature learning and classification. Specifically, the DRDCAE module leverages residual-dense connections to learn discriminative latent representations through joint reconstruction and classifica-tion, while the STGNN module captures dynamic spatial dependencies via a learnable graph adjacency matrix and models temporal dynamics using bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM). Extensive evaluations on BCI Competition IV 2a, 2b, and PhysioNet datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 95.42%, 97.51%, and 90.15%, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component, and interpreta-bility analysis reveals neurophysiologically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, despite its complexity, the model maintains a feasible parameter count and an inference time of 0.32 ms per sample. These results indicate that our method offers a robust, accurate, and interpretable solution for MI-EEG decoding, with strong generalizability across subjects and tasks and meeting the requirements for potential real-time BCI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submit to IEEE Journal</p></details> |

With upgrades scheduled for the detectors of colliding-beam experiments around the world, and specifically at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, more collisions and more complex interactions are expected. This directly implies an increase in data produced and consequently in the computational resources needed to process them. At CERN, the amount of data produced is gargantuan. This is why the data have to be heavily filtered and selected in real time before being permanently stored. This data can then be used to perform physics analyses, in order to expand our current understanding of the universe and improve the Standard Model of physics. This real-time filtering, known as triggering, involves complex processing happening often at frequencies as high as 40 MHz. This thesis contributes to understanding how machine learning models can be efficiently deployed in such environments, in order to maximize throughput and minimize energy consumption. Inevitably, modern hardware designed for such tasks and contemporary algorithms are needed in order to meet the challenges posed by the stringent, high-frequency data rates. In this work, I present our graph neural network-based pipeline, developed for charged particle track reconstruction at the LHCb experiment at CERN. The pipeline was implemented end-to-end inside LHCb's first-level trigger, entirely on GPUs. Its performance was compared against the classical tracking algorithms currently in production at LHCb. The pipeline was also accelerated on the FPGA architecture, and its performance in terms of power consumption and processing speed was compared against the GPU implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD t...</summary><p>PhD thesis, Chapters 8 and 9 include results from work performed in collaboration with Anthony Correia</p></details> |
| **[Pruning Spurious Subgraphs for Graph Out-of-Distribution Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05957v4)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often encounter significant performance degradation under distribution shifts between training and test data, hindering their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent studies have proposed various methods to address the out-of-distribution generalization challenge, with many methods in the graph domain focusing on directly identifying an invariant subgraph that is predictive of the target label. However, we argue that identifying the edges from the invariant subgraph directly is challenging and error-prone, especially when some spurious edges exhibit strong correlations with the targets. In this paper, we propose PrunE, the first pruning-based graph OOD method that eliminates spurious edges to improve OOD generalizability. By pruning spurious edges, PrunE retains the invariant subgraph more comprehensively, which is critical for OOD generalization. Specifically, PrunE employs two regularization terms to prune spurious edges: 1) graph size constraint to exclude uninformative spurious edges, and 2) $\epsilon$-probability alignment to further suppress the occurrence of spurious edges. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that PrunE achieves superior OOD performance and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods significantly.
