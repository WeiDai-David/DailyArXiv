| **[Bridging Simplicity and Sophistication using GLinear: A Novel Architecture for Enhanced Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01087v4)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is an important application across many fields. There is a debate about whether Transformers, despite being good at understanding long sequences, struggle with preserving temporal relationships in time series data. Recent research suggests that simpler linear models might outperform or at least provide competitive performance compared to complex Transformer-based models for TSF tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel data-efficient architecture, \textit{Gaussian-activated Linear model (GLinear)}, for multivariate TSF that exploits periodic patterns to provide better accuracy. It achieves higher prediction accuracy while requiring less historical data than other state-of-the-art linear predictors. Four different datasets (ETTh1, Electricity, Traffic, and Weather) are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed predictor. A performance comparison with state-of-the-art linear architectures (such as NLinear, DLinear, and RLinear) and transformer-based time series predictors (Autoformer) shows that the GLinear, despite being data efficient, outperforms the existing architectures in most cases of multivariate TSF while being competitive in others. We hope that the proposed GLinear model opens new fronts of research and development of simpler and more sophisticated architectures for data and computationally efficient time-series analysis.

| **[AdaWaveNet: Adaptive Wavelet Network for Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11124v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data analysis is a critical component in various domains such as finance, healthcare, and meteorology. Despite the progress in deep learning for time series analysis, there remains a challenge in addressing the non-stationary nature of time series data. Traditional models, which are built on the assumption of constant statistical properties over time, often struggle to capture the temporal dynamics in realistic time series, resulting in bias and error in time series analysis. This paper introduces the Adaptive Wavelet Network (AdaWaveNet), a novel approach that employs Adaptive Wavelet Transformation for multi-scale analysis of non-stationary time series data. AdaWaveNet designed a lifting scheme-based wavelet decomposition and construction mechanism for adaptive and learnable wavelet transforms, which offers enhanced flexibility and robustness in analysis. We conduct extensive experiments on 10 datasets across 3 different tasks, including forecasting, imputation, and a newly established super-resolution task. The evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaWaveNet over existing methods in all three tasks, which illustrates its potential in various real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trans...</summary><p>Transactions on Machine Learning Research; code: https://github.com/comp-well-org/AdaWaveNet ; TMLR review: https://openreview.net/forum?id=m4bE9Y9FlX</p></details> |
| **[A Vector-Quantized Foundation Model for Patient Behavior Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15221v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet their adoption in healthcare remains limited. While significant advances have been made in medical imaging, genetic biomarkers, and time series from electronic health records, the potential of foundation models for patient behavior monitoring through personal digital devices remains underexplored. The data generated by these devices are inherently heterogeneous, multisource, and often exhibit high rates of missing data, posing unique challenges. This paper introduces a novel foundation model based on a modified vector quantized variational autoencoder, specifically designed to process real-world data from smartphones and wearable devices. We leveraged the discrete latent representation of this model to effectively perform two downstream tasks, suicide risk assessment and emotional state prediction, on different held-out clinical cohorts without the need of fine-tuning. We also highlight the existence of a trade-off between discrete and continuous latent structures, suggesting that hybrid models may be optimal for balancing accuracy across various supervised and unsupervised tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (32 with references and supplementary material).

| **[Temporal Query Network for Efficient Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12917v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sufficiently modeling the correlations among variables (aka channels) is crucial for achieving accurate multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). In this paper, we propose a novel technique called Temporal Query (TQ) to more effectively capture multivariate correlations, thereby improving model performance in MTSF tasks. Technically, the TQ technique employs periodically shifted learnable vectors as queries in the attention mechanism to capture global inter-variable patterns, while the keys and values are derived from the raw input data to encode local, sample-level correlations. Building upon the TQ technique, we develop a simple yet efficient model named Temporal Query Network (TQNet), which employs only a single-layer attention mechanism and a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that TQNet learns more robust multivariate correlations, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across 12 challenging real-world datasets. Furthermore, TQNet achieves high efficiency comparable to linear-based methods even on high-dimensional datasets, balancing performance and computational cost. The code is available at: https://github.com/ACAT-SCUT/TQNet.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[FinMultiTime: A Four-Modal Bilingual Dataset for Financial Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05019v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pure time series forecasting tasks typically focus exclusively on numerical features; however, real-world financial decision-making demands the comparison and analysis of heterogeneous sources of information. Recent advances in deep learning and large scale language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in capturing sentiment and other qualitative signals, thereby enhancing the accuracy of financial time series predictions. Despite these advances, most existing datasets consist solely of price series and news text, are confined to a single market, and remain limited in scale. In this paper, we introduce FinMultiTime, the first large scale, multimodal financial time series dataset. FinMultiTime temporally aligns four distinct modalities financial news, structured financial tables, K-line technical charts, and stock price time series across both the S&P 500 and HS 300 universes. Covering 5,105 stocks from 2009 to 2025 in the United States and China, the dataset totals 112.6 GB and provides minute-level, daily, and quarterly resolutions, thus capturing short, medium, and long term market signals with high fidelity. Our experiments demonstrate that (1) scale and data quality markedly boost prediction accuracy; (2) multimodal fusion yields moderate gains in Transformer models; and (3) a fully reproducible pipeline enables seamless dataset updates.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Learning What Matters: Causal Time Series Modeling for Arctic Sea Ice Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09128v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional machine learning and deep learning models typically rely on correlation-based learning, which often fails to distinguish genuine causal relationships from spurious associations, limiting their robustness, interpretability, and ability to generalize. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a causality-aware deep learning framework that integrates Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection within a hybrid neural architecture. Leveraging 43 years (1979-2021) of Arctic Sea Ice Extent (SIE) data and associated ocean-atmospheric variables at daily and monthly resolutions, the proposed method identifies causally influential predictors, prioritizes direct causes of SIE dynamics, reduces unnecessary features, and enhances computational efficiency. Experimental results show that incorporating causal inputs leads to improved prediction accuracy and interpretability across varying lead times. While demonstrated on Arctic SIE forecasting, the framework is broadly applicable to other dynamic, high-dimensional domains, offering a scalable approach that advances both the theoretical foundations and practical performance of causality-informed predictive modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at the AI4TS Workshop @ IJCAI 2025 (non-archival)</p></details> |
| **[ANOVA for High-dimensional Non-stationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09079v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal dependence and the resulting autocovariances in time series data can introduce bias into ANOVA test statistics, thereby affecting their size and power. This manuscript accounts for temporal dependence in ANOVA and develops a test statistic suitable for high-dimensional, non-stationary time series. Recognizing that the presence of complex fourth-order cumulants may introduce difficulties in variance estimation of the test statistic, we develop a bootstrap algorithm to conduct hypothesis testing through computer simulations. Theoretical results including the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis and the validity of the proposed bootstrap algorithm are established. Numerical studies demonstrate a good finite-sample performance of the proposed test statistic. In addition to the new test procedure, this manuscript derives theoretical results on consistency, Gaussian approximation, and variance estimation for quadratic forms of high-dimensional non-stationary time series, which may be of independent interest to researchers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Inventory Networks: Toward Reliable Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11246v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We argue that inventory management presents unique opportunities for the reliable application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). To enable this, we emphasize and test two complementary techniques. The first is Hindsight Differentiable Policy Optimization (HDPO), which uses pathwise gradients from offline counterfactual simulations to directly and efficiently optimize policy performance. Unlike standard policy gradient methods that rely on high-variance score-function estimators, HDPO computes gradients by differentiating through the known system dynamics. Via extensive benchmarking, we show that HDPO recovers near-optimal policies in settings with known or bounded optima, is more robust than variants of the REINFORCE algorithm, and significantly outperforms generalized newsvendor heuristics on problems using real time series data. Our second technique aligns neural policy architectures with the topology of the inventory network. We exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a natural inductive bias for encoding supply chain structure, demonstrate that they can represent optimal and near-optimal policies in two theoretical settings, and empirically show that they reduce data requirements across six diverse inventory problems. A key obstacle to progress in this area is the lack of standardized benchmark problems. To address this gap, we open-source a suite of benchmark environments, along with our full codebase, to promote transparency and reproducibility. All resources are available at github.com/MatiasAlvo/Neural_inventory_control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spec2VolCAMU-Net: A Spectrogram-to-Volume Model for EEG-to-fMRI Reconstruction based on Multi-directional Time-Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder and Vision-Mamba U-Net](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09521v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is essential for mapping human brain activity; however, it remains costly and logistically challenging. If comparable volumes could be generated directly from widely available scalp electroencephalography (EEG), advanced neuroimaging would become significantly more accessible. Existing EEG-to-fMRI generators rely on plain Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that fail to capture cross-channel time-frequency cues or on heavy transformer/Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) decoders that strain memory and stability. To address these limitations, we propose Spec2VolCAMU-Net, a lightweight architecture featuring a Multi-directional Time-Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder for rich feature extraction and a Vision-Mamba U-Net decoder that uses linear-time state-space blocks for efficient long-range spatial modelling. We frame the goal of this work as establishing a new state of the art in the spatial fidelity of single-volume reconstruction, a foundational prerequisite for the ultimate aim of generating temporally coherent fMRI time series. Trained end-to-end with a hybrid SSI-MSE loss, Spec2VolCAMU-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on three public benchmarks, recording Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.693 on NODDI, 0.725 on Oddball and 0.788 on CN-EPFL, representing improvements of 14.5%, 14.9%, and 16.9% respectively over previous best SSIM scores. Furthermore, it achieves competitive Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) scores, particularly excelling on the CN-EPFL dataset with a 4.6% improvement over the previous best PSNR, thus striking a better balance in reconstruction quality. The proposed model is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications in clinical and research settings. The code is available at https://github.com/hdy6438/Spec2VolCAMU-Net.</p></details> |  |
| **[FoundationalECGNet: A Lightweight Foundational Model for ECG-based Multitask Cardiac Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08961v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide, underscoring the importance of accurate and scalable diagnostic systems. Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is central to detecting cardiac abnormalities, yet challenges such as noise, class imbalance, and dataset heterogeneity limit current methods. To address these issues, we propose FoundationalECGNet, a foundational framework for automated ECG classification. The model integrates a dual-stage denoising by Morlet and Daubechies wavelets transformation, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Time Series Transformers (TST) to jointly capture spatial and temporal dependencies in multi-channel ECG signals. FoundationalECGNet first distinguishes between Normal and Abnormal ECG signals, and then classifies the Abnormal signals into one of five cardiac conditions: Arrhythmias, Conduction Disorders, Myocardial Infarction, QT Abnormalities, or Hypertrophy. Across multiple datasets, the model achieves a 99% F1-score for Normal vs. Abnormal classification and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-class disease detection, including a 99% F1-score for Conduction Disorders and Hypertrophy, as well as a 98.9% F1-score for Arrhythmias. Additionally, the model provides risk level estimations to facilitate clinical decision-making. In conclusion, FoundationalECGNet represents a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable solution for automated ECG analysis, with the potential to improve diagnostic precision and patient outcomes in healthcare settings. We'll share the code after acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feature Representation and Clustering of Airport Congestion with Hurst Exponent and High Order Statistics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08952v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Air traffic controllers benefit from referencing historical dates with similar complex air traffic conditions to identify potential management measures and their effects, which is critical for understanding air transportation system laws and optimizing decisions. This study conducted data mining using flight timetables. It first explored airport congestion mechanisms and quantified congestion as time series, then proposed a higher-order cumulants based time series feature extraction method. This method was fused with other features to build a high-dimensional airport congestion feature vector, and finally K-means clustering was applied to extract and analyze congestion patterns. The clustering method was empirically validated with 2023 flight data from Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport and it accurately classified airport operational states. To verify universality, the same framework was applied to 6 airports under the "one-city, two-airports" layout in Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu. Results showed significant congestion pattern differences between existing and newly constructed airports. Conclusions confirm the proposed feature extraction and clustering framework is effective and universal, and it can accurately capture airport congestion dynamics. Under the "one-city, two-airports" layout, existing and newly constructed airports differ significantly in operational modes, and most single-airport city airports have operational modes highly consistent with existing airports. This study provides valuable decision-making references for airport managers and air traffic controllers. It helps them deepen understanding of air traffic dynamics and airport congestion patterns, thereby optimizing traffic management strategies and improving airport operational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum-Assisted Machine Learning Models for Enhanced Weather Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23408v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Machine Learning (QML) presents as a revolutionary approach to weather forecasting by using quantum computing to improve predictive modeling capabilities. In this study, we apply QML models, including Quantum Gated Recurrent Units (QGRUs), Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), Quantum Long Short-Term Memory(QLSTM), Variational Quantum Circuits(VQCs), and Quantum Support Vector Machines(QSVMs), to analyze meteorological time-series data from the ERA5 dataset. Our methodology includes preprocessing meteorological features, implementing QML architectures for both classification and regression tasks. The results demonstrate that QML models can achieve reasonable accuracy in both prediction and classification tasks, particularly in binary classification. However, challenges such as quantum hardware limitations and noise affect scalability and generalization. This research provides insights into the feasibility of QML for weather prediction, paving the way for further exploration of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks to enhance meteorological forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Will ...</summary><p>Will require more permissions and data to be republished later for academic rigor</p></details> |
| **[FinZero: Launching Multi-modal Financial Time Series Forecast with Large Reasoning Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08742v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial time series forecasting is both highly significant and challenging. Previous approaches typically standardized time series data before feeding it into forecasting models, but this encoding process inherently leads to a loss of important information. Moreover, past time series models generally require fixed numbers of variables or lookback window lengths, which further limits the scalability of time series forecasting. Besides, the interpretability and the uncertainty in forecasting remain areas requiring further research, as these factors directly impact the reliability and practical value of predictions. To address these issues, we first construct a diverse financial image-text dataset (FVLDB) and develop the Uncertainty-adjusted Group Relative Policy Optimization (UARPO) method to enable the model not only output predictions but also analyze the uncertainty of those predictions. We then proposed FinZero, a multimodal pre-trained model finetuned by UARPO to perform reasoning, prediction, and analytical understanding on the FVLDB financial time series. Extensive experiments validate that FinZero exhibits strong adaptability and scalability. After fine-tuning with UARPO, FinZero achieves an approximate 13.48\% improvement in prediction accuracy over GPT-4o in the high-confidence group, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning fine-tuning in multimodal large model, including in financial time series forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Compositional Reasoning in Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06037v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance across a wide range of domains. However, a question remains: Do TSFMs succeed by memorizing patterns in training data, or do they possess the ability to reason about such patterns? While reasoning is a topic of great interest in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is undefined and largely unexplored in the context of TSFMs. In this work, inspired by language modeling literature, we formally define compositional reasoning in forecasting and distinguish it from in-distribution generalization. We evaluate the reasoning and generalization capabilities of 16 popular deep learning forecasting models on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. Additionally, through controlled studies, we systematically examine which design choices in 7 popular open-source TSFMs contribute to improved reasoning capabilities. Our study yields key insights into the impact of TSFM architecture design on compositional reasoning and generalization. We find that patch-based Transformers have the best reasoning performance, closely followed by residualized MLP-based architectures, which are 97\% less computationally complex in terms of FLOPs and 86\% smaller in terms of the number of trainable parameters. Interestingly, in some zero-shot out-of-distribution scenarios, these models can outperform moving average and exponential smoothing statistical baselines trained on in-distribution data. Only a few design choices, such as the tokenization method, had a significant (negative) impact on Transformer model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adding structure to generalized additive models, with applications in ecology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07915v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized additive models (GAMs) connecting a set of scalar covariates that map 1-1 to a response are commonly employed in ecology and beyond. However, covariates are often inherently non-scalar, taking multiple values for each observation of the response. They can sometimes have a temporal structure, e.g., a time series of temperatures, or a spatial structure, e.g., multiple soil pH measurements made at nearby locations. While aggregating or selectively summarizing such covariates to yield a scalar covariate allows the use of standard GAM fitting procedures, exactly how to do so can be problematic and information is necessarily lost. Naively including all $p$ components of a vector-valued covariate as $p$ separate covariates, say, without recognizing the structure, can lead to problems of multicollinearity, data sets that are excessively wide given the sample size, and difficulty extracting the primary signal provided by the covariate. Here we introduce three useful extensions to GAMs that efficiently and effectively handle vector-valued covariates without requiring one to choose aggregations or selective summarizations. These extensions are varying-coefficient, scalar-on-function and distributed lag models. While these models have existed for some time they remain relatively underused in ecology. This article aims to show when these models can be useful and how to fit them with the popular R package \mgcv{}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material will be posted online once data access agreements are in place</p></details> |
| **[Assessing Bias in the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08647v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap(VBPBB) is an innovative method for time series with periodically correlated(PC) components. This method applies bandpass filters to extract specific PC components from datasets, effectively eliminating unwanted interference such as noise. It then bootstraps the PC components, maintaining their correlation structure while resampling and enabling a clearer analysis of the estimation of the statistical properties of periodic patterns in time series data. While its efficiency has been demonstrated in environmental and epidemiological research, the theoretical properties of VBPBB, particularly regarding its bias of the estimated sampling distributions, remain unexamined. This study investigates issues regarding biases in VBPBB, including overall mean bias and pointwise mean bias, across a range of time series models of varying complexity, all of which exhibit periodic components. Using the R programming language, we simulate various PC time series and apply VBPBB to assess its bias under different conditions. Our findings provide key insights into the validity of VBPBB for periodic time series analysis and offer practical recommendations for its implementation, as well as directions for future theoretical advancements.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

We develop novel autocovariance-based estimation and inference methods for this model. The methodology is broadly applicable to economic and statistical functional time series with nonstationary dynamics. To illustrate our methodology and its usefulness, we apply it to the evaluation of the global economic impact of climate change, an issue of intrinsic importance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Analysis of Time-Dependent Observables in Cell Signaling Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08589v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of a cell to communicate with its environment is essential for key cellular functions like replication, metabolism, or cell fate decisions. The involved molecular mechanisms are highly dynamic and difficult to capture experimentally. Simulation studies offer a valuable means for exploring and predicting how cell signaling processes unfold. We present a design study on the visual analysis of such studies to support 1) modelers in calibrating model parameters such that the simulated signal responses over time reflect reference behavior from cell biology research and 2) cell biologists in exploring the influence of receptor trafficking on the efficiency of signal transmission within the cell. We embed time series plots into parallel coordinates to enable a simultaneous analysis of model parameters and temporal outputs. A usage scenario illustrates how our approach assists with typical tasks such as assessing the plausibility of temporal outputs or their sensitivity across model configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAESTRO: Multi-modal Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08578v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public health decision-making. To address this, we present MAESTRO, a Multi-modal Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization. MAESTRO achieves robustness by adaptively fusing multi-modal inputs-including surveillance, web search trends, and meteorological data-and leveraging a comprehensive spectro-temporal architecture. The model first decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components. These are then processed through a hybrid feature enhancement pipeline combining Transformer-based encoders, a Mamba state-space model for long-range dependencies, multi-scale temporal convolutions, and a frequency-domain analysis module. A cross-channel attention mechanism further integrates information across the different data modalities. Finally, a temporal projection head performs sequence-to-sequence forecasting, with an optional estimator to quantify prediction uncertainty. Evaluated on over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period), MAESTRO shows strong competitive performance, demonstrating a superior model fit and relative accuracy, achieving a state-of-the-art R-square of 0.956. Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of both multi-modal fusion and the spectro-temporal components. Our modular and reproducible pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to other regions and pathogens.Our publicly available pipeline presents a powerful, unified framework, demonstrating the critical synergy of advanced spectro-temporal modeling and multi-modal data fusion for robust epidemiological forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparative Analysis of Global and Local Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting for Contiguous Spatial Demand Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08214v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluates three probabilistic forecasting strategies using LightGBM: global pooling, cluster-level pooling, and station-level modeling across a range of scenarios, from fully homogeneous simulated data to highly heterogeneous real-world Divvy bike-share demand observed during 2023 to 2024. Clustering was performed using the K-means algorithm applied to principal component analysis transformed covariates, which included time series features, counts of nearby transportation infrastructure, and local demographic characteristics. Forecasting performance was assessed using prediction interval coverage probability (PICP), normalized interval width (PINAW), and the mean squared error (MSE) of the median forecast. The results show that global LightGBM models incorporating station identifiers consistently outperform both cluster-level and station-level models across most scenarios. These global models effectively leverage the full cross-sectional dataset while enabling local adjustments through the station identifier, resulting in superior prediction interval coverage, sharper intervals, and lower forecast errors. In contrast, cluster-based models often suffer from residual within group heterogeneity, leading to degraded accuracy. Station-level models capture fine-grained local dynamics in heterogeneous settings. These findings underscore that global LightGBM models with embedded station identifiers provide a robust, scalable, and computationally efficient framework for transportation demand forecasting. By balancing global structure with local specificity, this approach offers a practical and effective solution for real-world mobility applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

They are used to quantify the difference between predicted outputs and ground truth labels, guiding the optimization process to minimize errors. Selecting the right loss function is critical, as it directly impacts model convergence, generalization, and overall performance across various applications, from computer vision to time series forecasting. This paper presents a comprehensive review of loss functions, covering fundamental metrics like Mean Squared Error and Cross-Entropy to advanced functions such as Adversarial and Diffusion losses. We explore their mathematical foundations, impact on model training, and strategic selection for various applications, including computer vision (Discriminative and generative), tabular data prediction, and time series forecasting. For each of these categories, we discuss the most used loss functions in the recent advancements of deep learning techniques. Also, this review explore the historical evolution, computational efficiency, and ongoing challenges in loss function design, underlining the need for more adaptive and robust solutions. Emphasis is placed on complex scenarios involving multi-modal data, class imbalances, and real-world constraints. Finally, we identify key future directions, advocating for loss functions that enhance interpretability, scalability, and generalization, leading to more effective and resilient deep learning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Customizing the Inductive Biases of Softmax Attention using Structured Matrices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07963v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The core component of attention is the scoring function, which transforms the inputs into low-dimensional queries and keys and takes the dot product of each pair. While the low-dimensional projection improves efficiency, it causes information loss for certain tasks that have intrinsically high-dimensional inputs. Additionally, attention uses the same scoring function for all input pairs, without imposing a distance-dependent compute bias for neighboring tokens in the sequence. In this work, we address these shortcomings by proposing new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured matrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level Low Rank (MLR) matrices. On in-context regression tasks with high-dimensional inputs, our proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any fixed compute budget. On language modeling, a task that exhibits locality patterns, our MLR-based attention method achieves improved scaling laws compared to both standard attention and variants of sliding window attention. Additionally, we show that both BTT and MLR fall under a broader family of efficient structured matrices capable of encoding either full-rank or distance-dependent compute biases, thereby addressing significant shortcomings of standard attention. Finally, we show that MLR attention has promising results for long-range time-series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025.

Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, from inception up to November 2024 to identify articles that propose and evaluate clustering techniques for CTS. Methods were classified according to three major families -- distance-based, feature-based, and model-based -- and assessed on their ability to handle data challenges such as variable sequence length, multivariate data, continuous time, missing data, time-invariant covariates, and large data volumes. Results: Out of 14607 studies, we included 124 articles describing 129 methods, spanning domains such as artificial intelligence, social sciences, and epidemiology. Distance-based methods, particularly those using Optimal Matching, were most prevalent, with 56 methods. We identified 28 model-based methods, which demonstrated superior flexibility for handling complex data structures such as multivariate data, continuous time and time-invariant covariates. We also recorded 45 feature-based approaches, which were on average more scalable but less flexible. A searchable Web application was developed to facilitate method selection based on dataset characteristics ( https://cts-clustering-scoping-review-7sxqj3sameqvmwkvnzfynz.streamlit.app/ ) Discussion: While distance-based methods dominate, model-based approaches offer the richest modeling potential but are less scalable. Feature-based methods favor performance over flexibility, with limited support for complex data structures. Conclusion: This review highlights methodological diversity and gaps in CTS clustering. The proposed typology aims to guide researchers in selecting appropriate methods for their specific use cases.</p></details> |  |

We proceed in two steps: first, we estimate a time trend for dementia using a multi-state Cox model. The multi-state model addresses problems of both interval censoring arising from infrequent measurement and also measurement error in dementia. Second, we feed the estimated mean and variance of the time trend into a Kalman filter to infer the population level dementia process. Using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), we find that dementia incidence is no longer declining in England. Furthermore, our forecast is that future incidence remains constant, although there is considerable uncertainty in this forecast. Our two-step estimation procedure has significant computational advantages by combining a multi-state model with a time series method. To account for the short sample that is available for dementia, we derive expressions for the Kalman filter's convergence speed, size, and power to detect changes and conclude our estimator performs well even in short samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Temporal Super-Resolution of Energy Data using Generative Adversarial Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10587v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue, this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application scenario is improved by 13%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting Russian Equipment Losses Using Time Series and Deep Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07813v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study applies a range of forecasting techniques,including ARIMA, Prophet, Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), and XGBoost, to model and predict Russian equipment losses during the ongoing war in Ukraine. Drawing on daily and monthly open-source intelligence (OSINT) data from WarSpotting, we aim to assess trends in attrition, evaluate model performance, and estimate future loss patterns through the end of 2025. Our findings show that deep learning models, particularly TCN and LSTM, produce stable and consistent forecasts, especially under conditions of high temporal granularity. By comparing different model architectures and input structures, this study highlights the importance of ensemble forecasting in conflict modeling, and the value of publicly available OSINT data in quantifying material degradation over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimation of Cointegration Vectors in Time Series via Global Optimisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02552v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Analysis has been given a great amount of study in which many useful tests were developed. The phenomenal work of Engle and Granger in 1987 and Johansen in 1988 has paved the way for the most commonly used cointegration tests so far. Even though cointegrating relationships focus on long-term behaviour and correlation of multiple nonstationary time series, oftentimes we encounter statistical data with limited sample sizes and other information. Thus other tests with empirical advantages may also be of considerable importance. In this paper, we provide an optimisation approach motivated by the Blind Source Separation, or also known as Independent Component Analysis, for cointegration between financial time series. Two methods for cointegration tests are introduced, namely decorrelation for the bivariate case and maximisation of nongaussianity for higher-dimensions. We highlight the empirical preponderances of independent components and also the computational simplicity, compared to common practices of cointegration such as the Johansen's Cointegration Test. The advantages of our methods, especially the better performances in limited sample size, enable a wider range of application and accessibility for researchers and practitioners to identify cointegrating relationships.</p></details> |  |
| **[IBN: An Interpretable Bidirectional-Modeling Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Variable Missing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07725v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) often faces challenges from missing variables, which hinder conventional spatial-temporal graph neural networks in modeling inter-variable correlations. While GinAR addresses variable missing using attention-based imputation and adaptive graph learning for the first time, it lacks interpretability and fails to capture more latent temporal patterns due to its simple recursive units (RUs). To overcome these limitations, we propose the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN), integrating Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) and Gaussian kernel-based Graph Convolution (GGCN). IBN estimates the uncertainty of reconstructed values using MC Dropout and applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to mitigate high-risk reconstructions. GGCN explicitly models spatial correlations among variables, while a bidirectional RU enhances temporal dependency modeling. Extensive experiments show that IBN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing a more reliable and interpretable framework for MTSF with missing variables. Code is available at: https://github.com/zhangth1211/NICLab-IBN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Driven Hierarchical Sampling for Unbalanced Continual Malware Detection with Time-Series Update-Based Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07532v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Android malware detection continues to face persistent challenges stemming from long-term concept drift and class imbalance, as evolving malicious behaviors and shifting usage patterns dynamically reshape feature distributions. Although continual learning (CL) mitigates drift, existing replay-based methods suffer from inherent bias. Specifically, their reliance on classifier uncertainty for sample selection disproportionately prioritizes the dominant benign class, causing overfitting and reduced generalization to evolving malware. To address these limitations, we propose a novel uncertainty-guided CL framework. First, we introduce a hierarchical balanced sampler that employs a dual-phase uncertainty strategy to dynamically balance benign and malicious samples while simultaneously selecting high-information, high-uncertainty instances within each class. This mechanism ensures class equilibrium across both replay and incremental data, thereby enhancing adaptability to emerging threats. Second, we augment the framework with a vector retrieval mechanism that exploits historical malware embeddings to identify evolved variants via similarity-based retrieval, thereby complementing classifier updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under strict low-label conditions (50 labels per phase). It achieves a true positive rate (TPR) of 92.95\% and a mean accuracy (mACC) of 94.26\%, which validates its efficacy for sustainable Android malware detection.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |

Accurately identifying the moments when unexpected errors or defects occur is essential, yet challenging due to scarce labels, unknown anomaly types, and complex correlations across dimensions. To address the scarcity and unreliability of labelled data, we use the Lorenzetti Simulator to generate synthetic events with injected calorimeter anomalies. We then assess the sensitivity of several time series anomaly detection methods, including transformer-based and other deep learning models. The approach employed here is generic and applicable to different detector designs and defects.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, Submission to SciPost proceedings for EuCAIFCon 2025</p></details> |
| **[Sequential Change-point Detection for Compositional Time Series with Exogenous Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18130v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential change-point detection for time series enables us to sequentially check the hypothesis that the model still holds as more and more data are observed. It is widely used in data monitoring in practice. In this work, we consider sequential change-point detection for compositional time series, time series in which the observations are proportions. For fitting compositional time series, we propose a generalized Beta AR(1) model, which can incorporate exogenous variables upon which the time series observations are dependent. We show the compositional time series are strictly stationary and geometrically ergodic and consider maximum likelihood estimation for model parameters. We show the partial MLEs are consistent and asymptotically normal and propose a parametric sequential change-point detection method for the compositional time series model. The change-point detection method is illustrated using a time series of Covid-19 positivity rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Highly Efficient Direct Analytics on Semantic-aware Time Series Data Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13246v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm to tackle the challenges of massive growing data traffic and sustainable data communication. It shifts the focus from data fidelity to goal-oriented or task-oriented semantic transmission. While deep learning-based methods are commonly used for semantic encoding and decoding, they struggle with the sequential nature of time series data and high computation cost, particularly in resource-constrained IoT environments. Data compression plays a crucial role in reducing transmission and storage costs, yet traditional data compression methods fall short of the demands of goal-oriented communication systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for direct analytics on time series data compressed by the SHRINK compression algorithm. Through experimentation using outlier detection as a case study, we show that our method outperforms baselines running on uncompressed data in multiple cases, with merely 1% difference in the worst case. Additionally, it achieves four times lower runtime on average and accesses approximately 10% of the data volume, which enables edge analytics with limited storage and computation power. These results demonstrate that our approach offers reliable, high-speed outlier detection analytics for diverse IoT applications while extracting semantics from time-series data, achieving high compression, and reducing data transmission.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of arXiv:2503.13246, with significant additional contributions</p></details> |

However, no prior studies have addressed the modeling of such data. To address this topic, this paper proposes a novel matrix-variate integer-valued autoregressive model. The key techniques lie in defining two leftand right-matricial thinning operators. The probabilistic and statistical properties of the proposed model are investigated. Furthermore, two estimation methods are developed: projection estimation and iterative least squares estimation. The corresponding asymptotic properties of these estimators are established. Additionally, the order-determination problem is addressed. In the simulation studies, the estimation results are given and the theoretical properties are verified. Finally, it is shown that the matrix-variate integer-valued autoregressive model is superior to the continuous matrix-variate autoregressive and multivariate integer-valued autoregressive models for matrix-variate integer-valued time series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[A novel statistical workflow for nonstationary modelling of successive Fréchet extremes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07296v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of the frequency and magnitude of successive extreme events in energy demand is critical for strategic resource planning. Traditional approaches based on extreme value theory (EVT) are typically limited to modelling isolated extreme events and struggle to capture the dynamics of temporally clustered extremes, such as those driven by prolonged extreme weather events. These limitations are exacerbated by the scarcity of historical data and computational costs of longrun simulations leading to high uncertainty in return level estimates for successive extremes. Here, we introduce a novel statistical framework leveraging recent theoretical advances in successive extreme value modelling in dynamical systems. Under reasonable assumptions of the time series data (e.g. the data follow a fat-tailed Fr\'{e}chet distribution), our tool allows for significantly more robust estimates of returns and magnitudes of successive extreme events compared to standard likelihood methods. We illustrate our statistical workflow on scenarios of forecasted gas supply levels from 2025 to 2050. Common measures of statistical accuracy are provided as benchmarks for comparison.</p></details> |  |
| **[Of Graphs and Tables: Zero-Shot Node Classification with Tabular Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07143v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving broad generalization across various graph data. However, existing GFMs are often trained on datasets that were shown to poorly represent real-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast, tabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction tasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated by this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and reformulate node classification as a tabular problem. Each node can be represented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns, enabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context learning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework that first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders, applies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their outputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world datasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and state-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for scalable and generalizable graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Normalization for CUSUM-based Change Detection in Locally Stationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07112v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel self-normalization procedure for CUSUM-based change detection in the mean of a locally stationary time series is introduced. Classical self-normalization relies on the factorization of a constant long-run variance and a stochastic factor. In this case, the CUSUM statistic can be divided by another statistic proportional to the long-run variance, so that the latter cancels. Thereby, a tedious estimation of the long-run variance can be avoided. Under local stationarity, the partial sum process converges to $\int_0^t \sigma(x) d B_x$ and no such factorization is possible. To overcome this obstacle, a self-normalized test statistic is constructed from a carefully designed bivariate partial-sum process. Weak convergence of the process is proven, and it is shown that the resulting self-normalized test attains asymptotic level $\alpha$ under the null hypothesis of no change, while being consistent against a broad class of alternatives. Extensive simulations demonstrate better finite-sample properties compared to existing methods. Applications to real data illustrate the method's practical effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Change point analysis, gradual changes, local stationarity, self-normalization, CUSUM test Info: 42 pages, 4 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Despite advances in deep generative models, there is no consensus metric for their evaluation. We focus on generative AI for financial time series in decision-making applications and employ the nested optimal transport distance, a time-causal variant of optimal transport distance, which is robust to tasks such as hedging, optimal stopping, and reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a statistically consistent, naturally parallelizable algorithm for its computation, achieving substantial speedups over existing approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Neural ARFIMA model for forecasting BRIC exchange rates with long memory under oil shocks and policy uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06697v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting of exchange rates remains a persistent challenge, particularly for emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC). These series exhibit long memory, nonlinearity, and non-stationarity properties that conventional time series models struggle to capture. Additionally, there exist several key drivers of exchange rate dynamics, including global economic policy uncertainty, US equity market volatility, US monetary policy uncertainty, oil price growth rates, and country-specific short-term interest rate differentials. These empirical complexities underscore the need for a flexible modeling framework that can jointly accommodate long memory, nonlinearity, and the influence of external drivers. To address these challenges, we propose a Neural AutoRegressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (NARFIMA) model that combines the long-memory representation of ARFIMA with the nonlinear learning capacity of neural networks, while flexibly incorporating exogenous causal variables. We establish theoretical properties of the model, including asymptotic stationarity of the NARFIMA process using Markov chains and nonlinear time series techniques. We quantify forecast uncertainty using conformal prediction intervals within the NARFIMA framework. Empirical results across six forecast horizons show that NARFIMA consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models in forecasting BRIC exchange rates. These findings provide new insights for policymakers and market participants navigating volatile financial conditions. The \texttt{narfima} \textbf{R} package provides an implementation of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Classification of Nitrogen Stress Severity in Plants Under Combined Stress Conditions Using Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06625v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses, both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment. Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral, and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data, document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low, medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies. We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop management and improved plant health.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 7 Tables</p></details> |

To address this, we present an AI system that creates expert-level scientific software whose goal is to maximize a quality metric. The system uses a Large Language Model (LLM) and Tree Search (TS) to systematically improve the quality metric and intelligently navigate the large space of possible solutions. The system achieves expert-level results when it explores and integrates complex research ideas from external sources. The effectiveness of tree search is demonstrated across a wide range of benchmarks. In bioinformatics, it discovered 40 novel methods for single-cell data analysis that outperformed the top human-developed methods on a public leaderboard. In epidemiology, it generated 14 models that outperformed the CDC ensemble and all other individual models for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. Our method also produced state-of-the-art software for geospatial analysis, neural activity prediction in zebrafish, time series forecasting and numerical solution of integrals. By devising and implementing novel solutions to diverse tasks, the system represents a significant step towards accelerating scientific progress.</p></details> | 71 pages, 26 figures |
| **[CAPMix: Robust Time Series Anomaly Detection Based on Abnormal Assumptions with Dual-Space Mixup](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06419v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a vital yet challenging task, particularly in scenarios where labeled anomalies are scarce and temporal dependencies are complex. Recent anomaly assumption (AA) approaches alleviate the lack of anomalies by injecting synthetic samples and training discriminative models. Despite promising results, these methods often suffer from two fundamental limitations: patchy generation, where scattered anomaly knowledge leads to overly simplistic or incoherent anomaly injection, and Anomaly Shift, where synthetic anomalies either resemble normal data too closely or diverge unrealistically from real anomalies, thereby distorting classification boundaries. In this paper, we propose CAPMix, a controllable anomaly augmentation framework that addresses both issues. First, we design a CutAddPaste mechanism to inject diverse and complex anomalies in a targeted manner, avoiding patchy generation. Second, we introduce a label revision strategy to adaptively refine anomaly labels, reducing the risk of anomaly shift. Finally, we employ dual-space mixup within a temporal convolutional network to enforce smoother and more robust decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, including AIOps, UCR, SWaT, WADI, and ESA, demonstrate that CAPMix achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with enhanced robustness against contaminated training data.

Main drawbacks of the standard PLV are it can be sensitive to noisy observations and does not provide uncertainty measures under finite samples. To overcome the difficulty, we propose a model-based PLV through nonparametric statistical modeling. Specifically, since the discrete time series of phase can be regarded as a functional observation taking values on circle, we employ a Bayesian model for circular-variate functional data, which gives denoising and inference on the resulting PLV values. The proposed model is defined through "wrapping" functional Gaussian models on real line, for which we develop an efficient posterior computation algorithm using Gibbs sampler. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation experiments based on real EEG data.</p></details> | 17 pages |

However, existing contrastive learning-based and prompt-based LM approaches tend to be biased, often assigning a primary role to time series modality while treating text modality as secondary. We classify these approaches under a temporal-primary paradigm, which may overlook the unique and critical task-relevant information embedded in text modality like clinical reports, thus failing to fully leverage mutual benefits and complementarity of different modalities. To fill this gap, we propose a novel textual-temporal multimodal learning paradigm that enables either modality to serve as the primary while being enhanced by the other, thereby effectively capturing modality-specific information and fostering cross-modal interaction. In specific, we design MedualTime, a language model composed of dual adapters to implement temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. Within each adapter, lightweight adaptation tokens are injected into the top layers of LM to encourage high-level modality fusion. The shared LM pipeline by dual adapters not only achieves adapter alignment but also enables efficient fine-tuning, reducing computational resources. Empirically, MedualTime demonstrates superior performance on medical data, achieving notable improvements of 8% accuracy and 12% F1 in supervised settings. Furthermore, MedualTime's transferability is validated by few-shot label transfer experiments from coarse-grained to fine-grained medical data. https://github.com/start2020/MedualTime</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

As a case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors. Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and enhance forecasting robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2nd edition of the Workshop in AI and Finance at ECAI-2025</p></details> |
| **[Text-Trained LLMs Can Zero-Shot Extrapolate PDE Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06322v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent in-context learning (ICL) capabilities across a range of tasks, including zero-shot time-series forecasting. We show that text-trained foundation models can accurately extrapolate spatiotemporal dynamics from discretized partial differential equation (PDE) solutions without fine-tuning or natural language prompting. Predictive accuracy improves with longer temporal contexts but degrades at finer spatial discretizations. In multi-step rollouts, where the model recursively predicts future spatial states over multiple time steps, errors grow algebraically with the time horizon, reminiscent of global error accumulation in classical finite-difference solvers. We interpret these trends as in-context neural scaling laws, where prediction quality varies predictably with both context length and output length. To better understand how LLMs are able to internally process PDE solutions so as to accurately roll them out, we analyze token-level output distributions and uncover a consistent ICL progression: beginning with syntactic pattern imitation, transitioning through an exploratory high-entropy phase, and culminating in confident, numerically grounded predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[WindFM: An Open-Source Foundation Model for Zero-Shot Wind Power Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06311v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality wind power forecasting is crucial for the operation of modern power grids. However, prevailing data-driven paradigms either train a site-specific model which cannot generalize to other locations or rely on fine-tuning of general-purpose time series foundation models which are difficult to incorporate domain-specific data in the energy sector. This paper introduces WindFM, a lightweight and generative Foundation Model designed specifically for probabilistic wind power forecasting. WindFM employs a discretize-and-generate framework. A specialized time-series tokenizer first converts continuous multivariate observations into discrete, hierarchical tokens. Subsequently, a decoder-only Transformer learns a universal representation of wind generation dynamics by autoregressively pre-training on these token sequences. Using the comprehensive WIND Toolkit dataset comprising approximately 150 billion time steps from more than 126,000 sites, WindFM develops a foundational understanding of the complex interplay between atmospheric conditions and power output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our compact 8.1M parameter model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on both deterministic and probabilistic tasks, outperforming specialized models and larger foundation models without any fine-tuning. In particular, WindFM exhibits strong adaptiveness under out-of-distribution data from a different continent, demonstrating the robustness and transferability of its learned representations. Our pre-trained model is publicly available at https://github.com/shiyu-coder/WindFM.</p></details> |  |

Largevars R package conducts a cointegration test for high-dimensional vector autoregressions of order k based on the large N, T asymptotics of Bykhovskaya and Gorin (2022, 2025). The implemented test is a modification of the Johansen likelihood ratio test. In the absence of cointegration the test converges to the partial sum of the Airy_1 point process, an object arising in random matrix theory. The package and this article contain simulated quantiles of the first ten partial sums of the Airy_1 point process that are precise up to the first 3 digits. We also include two examples using Largevars: an empirical example on S&P100 stocks and a simulated VAR(2) example.</p></details> | 21 pages |

Conformal inference provides a pivotal and flexible instrument for assessing the uncertainty of machine learning models through prediction sets. Recently, a series of online conformal inference methods updated thresholds of prediction sets by performing online gradient descent on a sequence of quantile loss functions. A drawback of such methods is that they only use the information of revealed non-conformity scores via miscoverage indicators but ignore error quantification, namely the distance between the non-conformity score and the current threshold. To accurately leverage the dynamic of miscoverage error, we propose \textit{Error-quantified Conformal Inference} (ECI) by smoothing the quantile loss function. ECI introduces a continuous and adaptive feedback scale with the miscoverage error, rather than simple binary feedback in existing methods. We establish a long-term coverage guarantee for ECI under arbitrary dependence and distribution shift. The extensive experimental results show that ECI can achieve valid miscoverage control and output tighter prediction sets than other baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 camera version (fixed the bug where citations could not be properly indexed in Google Scholar)</p></details> |
| **[Sequential Change-point Detection for Binomial Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17274v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A binomial time series describes binary behaviors of individuals within a group, which depend on group behaviors in the past. Binomial time series data is widely applied in fields such as infection tracking and behavior analysis. In this paper, we introduce a generalized Binomial AR($p$) model with exogenous variables based on Generalized Linear Model (GLM), prove the statistical properties of the model when $p = 1$, and provide a parameter estimation method. Then, we propose a sequential change-point detection method for the generalized Binomial AR(1) model, facilitate real-time data monitoring and triggering alarms when a change point is detected. We apply the generalized Binomial AR(1) model to weekly pneumonia \& influenza mortality data and successfully identify change points related to the COVID-19 outbreak using the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring General Associations in Time Series: An Adaptation and Empirical Evaluation of the CODEC Coefficient in Determining Autoregressive Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06111v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying the number of lags to include in an autoregressive model remains an open research problem due to the computational burden of treating it as a hyperparameter, especially in complex models. This study explores model-agnostic association measures, including Pearson, Spearman, and an adaptation of the recently proposed conditional dependence coefficient (CODEC), for guiding lag selection in time series. We adapt and implement the CODEC-based Feature Ordering by Conditional Independence (CODEC-FOCI) algorithm and evaluate its performance through extensive simulations across linear, nonlinear, stationary, nonstationary, seasonal, and heteroskedastic processes. Results show that CODEC outperforms classical correlation-based measures in nonlinear and nonstationary settings, especially for large sample sizes. In contrast, Pearson performs better in purely linear models. Applications to benchmark datasets confirm that the CODEC approach identifies lag structures consistent with those reported in the literature. These findings highlight CODEC's potential as a practical, model-free tool for exploratory lag identification in time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 10 figures.

| **[ARIES: Relation Assessment and Model Recommendation for Deep Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06060v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in deep learning models for time series forecasting have been significant. These models often leverage fundamental time series properties such as seasonality and non-stationarity, which may suggest an intrinsic link between model performance and data properties. However, existing benchmark datasets fail to offer diverse and well-defined temporal patterns, restricting the systematic evaluation of such connections. Additionally, there is no effective model recommendation approach, leading to high time and cost expenditures when testing different architectures across different downstream applications. For those reasons, we propose ARIES, a framework for assessing relation between time series properties and modeling strategies, and for recommending deep forcasting models for realistic time series. First, we construct a synthetic dataset with multiple distinct patterns, and design a comprehensive system to compute the properties of time series. Next, we conduct an extensive benchmarking of over 50 forecasting models, and establish the relationship between time series properties and modeling strategies. Our experimental results reveal a clear correlation. Based on these findings, we propose the first deep forecasting model recommender, capable of providing interpretable suggestions for real-world time series. In summary, ARIES is the first study to establish the relations between the properties of time series data and modeling strategies, while also implementing a model recommendation system.

| **[Joint modeling of low and high extremes using a multivariate extended generalized Pareto distribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05982v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In most risk assessment studies, it is important to accurately capture the entire distribution of the multivariate random vector of interest from low to high values. For example, in climate sciences, low precipitation events may lead to droughts, while heavy rainfall may generate large floods, and both of these extreme scenarios can have major impacts on the safety of people and infrastructure, as well as agricultural or other economic sectors. In the univariate case, the extended generalized Pareto distribution (eGPD) was specifically developed to accurately model low, moderate, and high precipitation intensities, while bypassing the threshold selection procedure usually conducted in extreme-value analyses. In this work, we extend this approach to the multivariate case. The proposed multivariate eGPD has the following appealing properties: (1) its marginal distributions behave like univariate eGPDs; (2) its lower and upper joint tails comply with multivariate extreme-value theory, with key parameters separately controlling dependence in each joint tail; and (3) the model allows for fast simulation and is thus amenable to simulation-based inference. We propose estimating model parameters by leveraging modern neural approaches, where a neural network, once trained, can provide point estimates, credible intervals, or full posterior approximations in a fraction of a second. Our new methodology is illustrated by application to daily rainfall times series data from the Netherlands. The proposed model is shown to provide satisfactory marginal and dependence fits from low to high quantiles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a General Time Series Forecasting Model with Unified Representation and Adaptive Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17478v3)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing availability of multi-domain time series data, there is an increasing demand for general forecasting models pre-trained on multi-source datasets to support diverse downstream prediction scenarios. Existing time series foundation models primarily focus on scaling up pre-training datasets and model sizes to enhance generalization performance. In this paper, we take a different approach by addressing two critical aspects of general forecasting models: (1) how to derive unified representations from heterogeneous multi-domain time series data, and (2) how to effectively capture domain-specific features to enable adaptive transfer across various downstream scenarios. To address the first aspect, we propose Decomposed Frequency Learning as the pre-training task, which leverages frequency-based masking and reconstruction to decompose coupled semantic information in time series, resulting in unified representations across domains. For the second aspect, we introduce the Time Series Register, which captures domain-specific representations during pre-training and enhances adaptive transferability to downstream tasks. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art forecasting performance on seven real-world benchmarks, demonstrating remarkable few-shot and zero-shot capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Forty-second International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML2025)</p></details> |
| **[DACAD: Domain Adaptation Contrastive Learning for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11269v4)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time series anomaly detection (TSAD), the scarcity of labeled data poses a challenge to the development of accurate models. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by leveraging labeled data from a related domain to detect anomalies in an unlabeled target domain. However, existing UDA methods assume consistent anomalous classes across domains. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation Contrastive learning model for Anomaly Detection in multivariate time series (DACAD), combining UDA with contrastive learning. DACAD utilizes an anomaly injection mechanism that enhances generalization across unseen anomalous classes, improving adaptability and robustness. Additionally, our model employs supervised contrastive loss for the source domain and self-supervised contrastive triplet loss for the target domain, ensuring comprehensive feature representation learning and domain-invariant feature extraction. Finally, an effective Center-based Entropy Classifier (CEC) accurately learns normal boundaries in the source domain. Extensive evaluations on multiple real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset highlight DACAD's superior performance in transferring knowledge across domains and mitigating the challenge of limited labeled data in TSAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

And can their internal representations be leveraged to simulate rare, high-stakes events such as market crashes? To investigate this, we introduce activation transplantation, a causal intervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing the statistical moments of one event (e.g., a historical crash) onto another (e.g., a calm period) during the forward pass. This procedure deterministically steers forecasts: injecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm semantics suppresses crashes and restores stability. Beyond binary control, we find that models encode a graded notion of event severity, with the latent vector norm directly correlating with the magnitude of systemic shocks. Validated across two architecturally distinct TSFMs, Toto (decoder only) and Chronos (encoder-decoder), our results demonstrate that steerable, semantically grounded representations are a robust property of large time series transformers. Our findings provide evidence for a latent concept space that governs model predictions, shifting interpretability from post-hoc attribution to direct causal intervention, and enabling semantic "what-if" analysis for strategic stress-testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Generalize Learning in Agent-Based Models: Going Beyond Surrogate Models for Calibration in ABMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07013v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Calibrating agent-based epidemic models is computationally demanding. We present a supervised machine learning calibrator that learns the inverse mapping from epidemic time series to SIR parameters. A three-layer bidirectional LSTM ingests 60-day incidence together with population size and recovery rate, and outputs transmission probability, contact rate, and R0. Training uses a composite loss with an epidemiology-motivated consistency penalty that encourages R0 \* recovery rate to equal transmission probability \* contact rate. In a 1000-scenario simulation study, we compare the calibrator with Approximate Bayesian Computation (likelihood-free MCMC). The method achieves lower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs 0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), produces tighter predictive intervals with near nominal coverage, and reduces wall clock time from 77.4 s to 2.35 s per calibration. Although contact rate and transmission probability are partially nonidentifiable, the approach reproduces epidemic curves more faithfully than ABC, enabling fast and practical calibration. We evaluate it on SIR agent based epidemics generated with epiworldR and provide an implementation in R.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances in time series forecasting have led to progress, existing benchmarks remain limited in spatial and temporal scope and lack multi-energy features. This raises concerns about their reliability and applicability in real-world deployment. To address this, we present the Real-E dataset, covering over 74 power stations across 30+ European countries over a 10-year span with rich metadata. Using Real- E, we conduct an extensive data analysis and benchmark over 20 baselines across various model types. We introduce a new metric to quantify shifts in correlation structures and show that existing methods struggle on our dataset, which exhibits more complex and non-stationary correlation dynamics. Our findings highlight key limitations of current methods and offer a strong empirical basis for building more robust forecasting models</p></details> | 4 pages, CIKM 2025 |
| **[WISE: A Weighted Similarity Aggregation Test for Serial Independence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05678v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a nonparametric test for serial independence that aggregates pairwise similarities of observations with lag-dependent weights. The resulting statistic is powerful to general forms of temporal dependence, including nonlinear and uncorrelated alternatives, and applies to ultra-high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data. We derive asymptotic normality under both permutation and population nulls, and establish consistency in classical large-sample and high-dimension-low-sample-size (HDLSS) regimes. The test therefore provides the first theoretical power guarantees for serial independence in the HDLSS setting. Simulations demonstrate accurate size and strong power against a wide range of alternatives, showing significant power improvement over existing methods under various high-dimensional time series models. An application to spatio-temporal data illustrates the method's utility for non-Euclidean observations.</p></details> |  |
| **[DQS: A Low-Budget Query Strategy for Enhancing Unsupervised Data-driven Anomaly Detection Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05663v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Truly unsupervised approaches for time series anomaly detection are rare in the literature. Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which hampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be unsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is often not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning with an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying the labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the threshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query strategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to maximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between anomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance of DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of mislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings indicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others appear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real world, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and the number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query strategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of mislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an active learning-based threshold is recommended.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Reliability Engineering & System Safety journal</p></details> |

However, their large parameter counts pose significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. We propose a novel unstructured pruning framework tailored for Mamba models that achieves up to 70\% parameter reduction while retaining over 95\% of the original performance. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a gradient-aware magnitude pruning technique that combines weight magnitude and gradient information to identify less critical parameters, (2) an iterative pruning schedule that gradually increases sparsity to maintain model stability, and (3) a global pruning strategy that optimizes parameter allocation across the entire model. Through extensive experiments on WikiText-103, Long Range Arena, and ETT time-series benchmarks, we demonstrate significant efficiency gains with minimal performance degradation. Our analysis of pruning effects on Mamba's components reveals critical insights into the architecture's redundancy and robustness, enabling practical deployment in resource-constrained settings while broadening Mamba's applicability.</p></details> |  |

While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches mitigate label scarcity by data augmentations or time point-based contrastive strategy, they neglect the intrinsic periodic structure of MTS and fail to capture the dynamic evolution of latent states. We propose PLanTS, a periodicity-aware self-supervised learning framework that explicitly models irregular latent states and their transitions. We first designed a period-aware multi-granularity patching mechanism and a generalized contrastive loss to preserve both instance-level and state-level similarities across multiple temporal resolutions. To further capture temporal dynamics, we design a next-transition prediction pretext task that encourages representations to encode predictive information about future state evolution. We evaluate PLanTS across a wide range of downstream tasks-including multi-class and multi-label classification, forecasting, trajectory tracking and anomaly detection. PLanTS consistently improves the representation quality over existing SSL methods and demonstrates superior runtime efficiency compared to DTW-based methods.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods have shown promise in unconditional single-domain TSG, real-world applications demand for cross-domain approaches capable of controlled generation tailored to domain-specific constraints and instance-level requirements. In this paper, we argue that text can provide semantic insights, domain information and instance-specific temporal patterns, to guide and improve TSG. We introduce ``Text-Controlled TSG'', a task focused on generating realistic time series by incorporating textual descriptions. To address data scarcity in this setting, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework that synthesizes diverse, realistic text-to-TS datasets. Furthermore, we introduce BRIDGE, a hybrid text-controlled TSG framework that integrates semantic prototypes with text description for supporting domain-level guidance. This approach achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity on 11 of 12 datasets, and improves controllability by up to 12% on MSE and 6% MAE compared to no text input generation, highlighting its potential for generating tailored time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[BEDTime: A Unified Benchmark for Automatically Describing Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05215v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many recent studies have proposed general-purpose foundation models designed for a variety of time series analysis tasks. While several established datasets already exist for evaluating these models, previous works frequently introduce their models in conjunction with new datasets, limiting opportunities for direct, independent comparisons and obscuring insights into the relative strengths of different methods. Additionally, prior evaluations often cover numerous tasks simultaneously, assessing a broad range of model abilities without clearly pinpointing which capabilities contribute to overall performance. To address these gaps, we formalize and evaluate 3 tasks that test a model's ability to describe time series using generic natural language: (1) recognition (True/False question-answering), (2) differentiation (multiple choice question-answering), and (3) generation (open-ended natural language description). We then unify 4 recent datasets to enable head-to-head model comparisons on each task. Experimentally, in evaluating 13 state-of-the-art language, vision--language, and time series--language models, we find that (1) popular language-only methods largely underperform, indicating a need for time series-specific architectures, (2) VLMs are quite successful, as expected, identifying the value of vision models for these tasks and (3) pretrained multimodal time series--language models successfully outperform LLMs, but still have significant room for improvement. We also find that all approaches exhibit clear fragility in a range of robustness tests. Overall, our benchmark provides a standardized evaluation on a task necessary for time series reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |

Web service traffic is characterized by frequent and drastic fluctuations over time and are influenced by heterogeneous web user behaviors, making accurate prediction a challenging task. Previous research has extensively explored statistical approaches, and neural networks to mine features from preceding service traffic time series for prediction. However, these methods have largely overlooked the causal relationships between services. Drawing inspiration from causality in ecological systems, we empirically recognize the causal relationships between web services. To leverage these relationships for improved web service traffic prediction, we propose an effective neural network module, CCMPlus, designed to extract causal relationship features across services. This module can be seamlessly integrated with existing time series models to consistently enhance the performance of web service traffic predictions. We theoretically justify that the causal correlation matrix generated by the CCMPlus module captures causal relationships among services. Empirical results on real-world datasets from Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Group, and Ant Group confirm that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for predicting service traffic time series. These findings highlight the efficacy of leveraging causal relationships for improved predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>time ...</summary><p>time series, web service, web traffic, causality, more experiments</p></details> |

We propose to combine a two-step procedure for tensor decomposition with data truncation, which is easy to implement and does not require an iterative search for a numerical solution. Departing away from the light-tail assumptions often adopted in the time series factor modelling literature, we derive the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators while assuming the existence of the $(2 + 2\epsilon)$-th moment only for some $\epsilon \in (0, 1)$. Our rates explicitly depend on $\eps$ characterising the effect of heavy tails, and on the chosen level of truncation. We also propose a consistent criterion for determining the number of factors. Simulation studies and applications to two macroeconomic datasets demonstrate the good performance of the proposed estimators.</p></details> |  |

Using a combination of functional principal component analysis (FPCA) and dynamic factor methods, we analyze three distinct pools over multiple sample periods. Our findings offer three main contributions: a statistical characterization of automated market maker liquidity, an interpretable and portable basis for dimension reduction, and a robust analysis of liquidity dynamics using rolling window metrics. For the 5 bps pools, the leading empirical eigenfunctions explain the majority of cross-tick variation and remain stable, aligning closely with a low-order Legendre polynomial basis. This alignment provides a parsimonious and interpretable structure, similar to the dynamic Nelson-Siegel method for yield curves. The factor coefficients exhibit a time series structure well-captured by AR(1) models with clear GARCH-type heteroskedasticity and heavy-tailed innovations.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a novel Wasserstein distance-based loss to align generated and real unlabeled samples while simultaneously maximizing classification accuracy on labeled data. Our approach is evaluated on the BankSim dataset, a widely used simulator for credit card transaction data, under varying proportions of labeled samples, demonstrating consistent improvements over benchmarks in both global statistical and domain-specific metrics. These findings highlight the effectiveness of GAN-driven semi-supervised learning with log-signatures for irregularly sampled time series and emphasize the importance of uncertainty-aware predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated references in v2</p></details> |

Especially, predicting returns on financial instruments is a challenging problem. Some researchers have proposed time series foundation models applicable to various forecasting tasks. Simultaneously, based on the recognition that real-world time series exhibit chaotic properties, methods have been developed to artificially generate synthetic chaotic time series, construct diverse datasets and train models. In this study, we propose a methodology for modeling financial time series by generating artificial chaotic time series and applying resampling techniques to simulate financial time series data, which we then use as training samples. Increasing the resampling interval to extend predictive horizons, we conducted large-scale pre-training using 10 billion training samples for each case. We subsequently created test datasets for multiple timeframes using actual Bitcoin trade data and performed zero-shot prediction without re-training the pre-trained model. The results of evaluating the profitability of a simple trading strategy based on these predictions demonstrated significant performance improvements over autocorrelation models. During the large-scale pre-training process, we observed a scaling law-like phenomenon that we can achieve predictive performance at a certain level with extended predictive horizons for chaotic time series by increasing the number of training samples exponentially. If this scaling law proves robust and holds true across various chaotic models, it suggests the potential to predict near-future events by investing substantial computational resources. Future research should focus on further large-scale training and verifying the applicability of this scaling law to diverse chaotic models.</p></details> | Patent pending |

Recent work, like the Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS), shows that removing self-attention can make the model more accurate and efficient. However, these streamlined architectures may overlook the fine-grained, local temporal dependencies effectively captured by classical statistical models like Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average model (VARMA). To address this gap, we propose VARMAformer, a novel architecture that synergizes the efficiency of a cross-attention-only framework with the principles of classical time series analysis. Our model introduces two key innovations: (1) a dedicated VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models autoregressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) patterns at the patch level, and (2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism that employs a temporal gate to make queries more context-aware. By fusing these classical insights into a modern backbone, VARMAformer captures both global, long-range dependencies and local, statistical structures. Through extensive experiments on widely-used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work validates the significant benefit of integrating classical statistical insights into modern deep learning frameworks for time series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>The P...</summary><p>The Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence - PRICAI2025</p></details> |

Flickering is a hallmark of reduced resilience in climate systems, ecosystems, financial markets, and other systems. It can precede critical regime shifts that are highly impactful but difficult to predict. Here we show that convolutional long short-term memory (CNN LSTM) models, trained on synthetic time series generated from simple polynomial functions with additive noise, can accurately identify flickering patterns. Despite being trained on simplified dynamics, our models generalize to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detect flickering in empirical datasets, including dormouse body temperature records and palaeoclimate proxies from the African Humid Period. These findings demonstrate that deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy, nonlinear time series, providing a flexible framework for identifying instability across a wide range of dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Applying non-negative matrix factorization with covariates to multivariate time series data as a vector autoregression model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17446v3)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for analyzing multivariate time series (MTS) data by integrating non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with vector autoregression (VAR). Termed NMF-VAR, this method models the coefficient matrix of NMF as a VAR process, enabling simultaneous extraction of latent components and temporal dependencies. Unlike standard VAR, which struggles with high dimensionality and lacks clarity, our method introduces a low-rank latent structure that reduces the number of parameters while retaining explanatory power. The proposed framework generalizes the standard VAR model to high-dimensional non-negative data, including the standard VAR as a special case. We formulate the estimation as a constrained optimization problem and present multiplicative update rules for NMF based on existing tri-factorization techniques. We evaluate the method on three real-world datasets: quarterly first-differenced macroeconomic indicators of Canada, monthly international airline passenger volumes, and daily COVID-19 infection counts across Japanese prefectures. The results demonstrate that NMF-VAR effectively captures meaningful patterns such as economic cycles, seasonal travel behavior, and regional epidemic trends. Moreover, the method yields a significant reduction in regression parameters, improving both scalability and model transparency. Overall, NMF-VAR provides an efficient and insightful tool for analyzing high-dimensional and large-scale time series data.</p></details> | 10 figures |
| **[Continuum Attention for Neural Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06486v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers, and the attention mechanism in particular, have become ubiquitous in machine learning. Their success in modeling nonlocal, long-range correlations has led to their widespread adoption in natural language processing, computer vision, and time series problems. Neural operators, which map spaces of functions into spaces of functions, are necessarily both nonlinear and nonlocal if they are universal; it is thus natural to ask whether the attention mechanism can be used in the design of neural operators. Motivated by this, we study transformers in the function space setting. We formulate attention as a map between infinite dimensional function spaces and prove that the attention mechanism as implemented in practice is a Monte Carlo or finite difference approximation of this operator. The function space formulation allows for the design of transformer neural operators, a class of architectures designed to learn mappings between function spaces. In this paper, we state and prove the first universal approximation result for transformer neural operators, using only a slight modification of the architecture implemented in practice. The prohibitive cost of applying the attention operator to functions defined on multi-dimensional domains leads to the need for more efficient attention-based architectures. For this reason we also introduce a function space generalization of the patching strategy from computer vision, and introduce a class of associated neural operators. Numerical results, on an array of operator learning problems, demonstrate the promise of our approaches to function space formulations of attention and their use in neural operators.</p></details> |  |

Each node is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware evaluation in microservice systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[History matching for functional data and its application to tsunami warnings in the Indian Ocean](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04342v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional History Matching (HM) identifies implausible regions of the input parameter space by comparing scalar outputs of a computer model to observations. It offers higher computational efficiency than Bayesian calibration, making it suitable for high-dimensional problems. However, in real physical systems, outputs are often functional, such as time series or spatial fields, and conventional HM cannot fully exploit such information. We propose a novel method, Functional History Matching (FHM), which extends HM to handle functional data. FHM incorporates the Outer Product Emulator, an extension of the Gaussian Process emulator designed for time series, to enhance computational efficiency. FHM also leverages Random Projection to extract dynamic features from infinite-dimensional data, including derivatives. FHM supports uncertainty quantification essential for decision-making and naturally accommodates model discrepancies. To demonstrate its practical effectiveness, we apply FHM to a synthetic tsunami forecasting scenario in the Indian Ocean, assuming a realistic event in the Makran subduction zone. Wave elevation time series from offshore buoy data are used to predict wave elevations over the Indian coastline. Our results show that FHM significantly outperforms scalar-based HM in accuracy. FHM enables reliable forecasting from functional data within feasible computational constraints, offering a robust framework for early warning systems and beyond.</p></details> | 56 pages, 20 figures |

Extensive research has confirmed that no single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths. ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks. Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.</p></details> |  |

While extensively studied on classification models, their impact on time series forecasting remains largely unexplored. We address this gap by introducing two new attacks: (i) an adaptation of multivariate LiRA, a state-of-the-art MIA originally developed for classification models, to the time-series forecasting setting, and (ii) a novel end-to-end learning approach called Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. We benchmark these methods against adapted versions of other leading attacks from the classification setting. We evaluate all attacks in realistic settings on the TUH-EEG and ELD datasets, targeting two strong forecasting architectures, LSTM and the state-of-the-art N-HiTS, under both record- and user-level threat models. Our results show that forecasting models are vulnerable, with user-level attacks often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods achieve the strongest performance in several settings, establishing new baselines for privacy risk assessment in time series forecasting. Furthermore, vulnerability increases with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, echoing trends observed in large language models.</p></details> |  |

| **[Probabilistic QoS Metric Forecasting in Delay-Tolerant Networks Using Conditional Diffusion Models on Latent Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08821v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active QoS metric prediction, commonly employed in the maintenance and operation of DTN, could enhance network performance regarding latency, throughput, energy consumption, and dependability. Naturally formulated as a multivariate time series forecasting problem, it attracts substantial research efforts. Traditional mean regression methods for time series forecasting cannot capture the data complexity adequately, resulting in deteriorated performance in operational tasks in DTNs such as routing. This paper formulates the prediction of QoS metrics in DTN as a probabilistic forecasting problem on multivariate time series, where one could quantify the uncertainty of forecasts by characterizing the distribution of these samples. The proposed approach hires diffusion models and incorporates the latent temporal dynamics of non-stationary and multi-mode data into them. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach by showing that it outperforms the popular probabilistic time series forecasting methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial disaggregation of time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04065v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal modeling of economic aggregates is increasingly relevant in regional science due to the presence of both spatial spillovers and temporal dynamics. Traditional temporal disaggregation methods, such as Chow-Lin, often ignore spatial dependence, potentially losing important regional information. We propose a novel methodology for spatiotemporal disaggregation, integrating spatial autoregressive models, benchmarking restrictions, and auxiliary covariates. The approach accommodates partially observed regional data through an anchoring mechanism, ensuring consistency with known aggregates while reducing prediction variance. We establish identifiability and asymptotic normality of the estimator under general conditions, including non-Gaussian and heteroskedastic residuals. Extensive simulations confirm the method's robustness across a wide range of spatial autocorrelations and covariate informativeness. The methodology is illustrated by disaggregating Spanish GDP into 17 autonomous communities from 2002 to 2023, using auxiliary indicators and principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction. This framework extends classical temporal disaggregation to the spatial domain, providing accurate regional estimates while accounting for spatial spillovers and irregular data availability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Generative Models Meet Compressed Sensing, with Applications to Image Data and Financial Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03898v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops dimension reduction techniques for accelerating diffusion model inference in the context of synthetic data generation. The idea is to integrate compressed sensing into diffusion models: (i) compress the data into a latent space, (ii) train a diffusion model in the latent space, and (iii) apply a compressed sensing algorithm to the samples generated in the latent space, facilitating the efficiency of both model training and inference. Under suitable sparsity assumptions on data, the proposed algorithm is proved to enjoy faster convergence by combining diffusion model inference with sparse recovery. As a byproduct, we obtain an optimal value for the latent space dimension. We also conduct numerical experiments on a range of datasets, including image data (handwritten digits, medical images, and climate data) and financial time series for stress testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reduce-Rank Matrix Integer-Valued Autoregressive Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03338v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integer-valued time series are widely present in many fields, such as finance, economics, disease transmission, and traffic flow. With data dimensions surging, the traditional multivariate generalized integer autoregressive (MGINAR) model faces parameter overload, poor interpretability, and structural information loss. Matrix integer-valued autoregression (MINAR) model captures row-column cross-correlations and reduces the number of parameters to be estimated. However, further growth in dimensionality causes data redundancy, which degrades the MINAR model's performance and increases the number of parameters. To solve the limitations of the MINAR model described above, this paper proposes the reduced-rank matrix integer-valued autoregression (RRMINAR) model. Reducing rank is achieved by adding low-rank constraints to the coefficient matrices in the MINAR model, leading to RRMINAR reducing parameter quantity while incorporating matrix structure information. We develop an iterative conditional least squares estimation and analyze its asymptotic properties. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RRMINAR model exhibits more robust parameter estimation and higher prediction accuracy than MGINAR and MINAR models when the data structure is low-rank. Empirical analysis using criminal data validates the proposed RRMINAR model's effectiveness and uncovers structural temporal-spatial information in criminal behavior.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods have shown promising results owing to their strong ability to capture intra- and inter-variate dependencies. However, these methods often overlook lead-lag dependencies at multiple grouping scales, failing to capture hierarchical lead-lag effects in complex systems. To this end, we propose MillGNN, a novel \underline{g}raph \underline{n}eural \underline{n}etwork-based method that learns \underline{m}ult\underline{i}ple grouping scale \underline{l}ead-\underline{l}ag dependencies for MTS forecasting, which can comprehensively capture lead-lag effects considering variate-wise and group-wise dynamics and decays. Specifically, MillGNN introduces two key innovations: (1) a scale-specific lead-lag graph learning module that integrates cross-correlation coefficients and dynamic decaying features derived from real-time inputs and time lags to learn lead-lag dependencies for each scale, which can model evolving lead-lag dependencies with statistical interpretability and data-driven flexibility; (2) a hierarchical lead-lag message passing module that passes lead-lag messages at multiple grouping scales in a structured way to simultaneously propagate intra- and inter-scale lead-lag effects, which can capture multi-scale lead-lag effects with a balance of comprehensiveness and efficiency. Experimental results on 11 datasets demonstrate the superiority of MillGNN for long-term and short-term MTS forecasting, compared with 16 state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods typically rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets. Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification, which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and zero-shot approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Occupancy-aware Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Valet Parking in Uncertain Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09206v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately reasoning about future parking spot availability and integrated planning is critical for enabling safe and efficient autonomous valet parking in dynamic, uncertain environments. Unlike existing methods that rely solely on instantaneous observations or static assumptions, we present an approach that predicts future parking spot occupancy by explicitly distinguishing between initially vacant and occupied spots, and by leveraging the predicted motion of dynamic agents. We introduce a probabilistic spot occupancy estimator that incorporates partial and noisy observations within a limited Field-of-View (FoV) model and accounts for the evolving uncertainty of unobserved regions. Coupled with this, we design a strategy planner that adaptively balances goal-directed parking maneuvers with exploratory navigation based on information gain, and intelligently incorporates wait-and-go behaviors at promising spots. Through randomized simulations emulating large parking lots, we demonstrate that our framework significantly improves parking efficiency, safety margins, and trajectory smoothness compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[MGTraj: Multi-Granularity Goal-Guided Human Trajectory Prediction with Recursive Refinement Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09200v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities: coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.</p></details> |  |

If a planned trajectory violates traffic rules, it is common to replan a new trajectory from scratch. We instead propose a trajectory repair technique to save computation time. By coupling satisfiability modulo theories with set-based reachability analysis, we determine if and in what manner the initial trajectory can be repaired. Experiments in high-fidelity simulators and in the real world demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach in various scenarios. Even in complex environments with intricate rules, we efficiently and reliably repair rule-violating trajectories, enabling automated vehicles to swiftly resume legally safe operation in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE.

Existing methods often face high computational cost or rely on external safety critics. To address this, we propose an Interaction-Enriched Unified Potential Field (IUPF) framework that fuses style-dependent benefit and risk fields through a physics-inspired variational model, grounded in mean field game theory. The approach captures conservative, aggressive, and cooperative behaviors without additional safety modules, and employs stochastic differential equations to guarantee Nash equilibrium with exponential convergence. Simulations on lane changing and overtaking scenarios show that IUPF ensures safe distances, generates smooth and efficient trajectories, and outperforms traditional optimization and game-theoretic baselines in both adaptability and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

The gradient constraint is enforced by thresholding the $\ell_2$-norm of the next gradient vector. The constraints form a quadratic equation. To ensure the existence of the solution, a novel Discrete-Time Forward and Backward Sweep (DTFBS) strategy is proposed. To ensure the existence of the trajectory derivatives, the trajectory function is reparameterized as a piecewise cubic polynomial function with $C^2$ continuity. To ensure trajectory fidelity, the output gradient waveform is reparameterized by the finite difference of the trajectory samples. Simulation experiments across seven commonly adopted non-Cartesian trajectories were conducted to validate generality, time-optimality, real-time capability, slew-rate accuracy, and improvements over prior work. Imaging feasibility of the designed time-optimal gradient waveform was validated in phantom and in vivo experiments. \textbf{Results: }The proposed method achieves a $>89\%$ reduction in computation time and simultaneously reduces slew-rate overshoot by $>98\%$ compared to the prior method across all involved trajectories. The computation time of the proposed method is shorter than the gradient duration for all tested cases, validating the real-time capability of the proposed method. \textbf{Conclusions: }The proposed method enables real-time and hardware-compliant gradient waveform design, achieving significant reductions in computation time and slew-rate overshoot compared to the previous method. \textbf{Significance: }This is the first method achieving real-time gradient waveform design for arbitrary $k$-space trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Resource Estimation and Trajectory Optimization for eVTOL-involved CR network: A Monte Carlo Tree Search-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18031v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, pivotal to Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), are emerging as a transformative transportation paradigm with the potential to redefine urban and regional mobility. While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Generalized Hamiltonian Dynamics with Stability from Noisy Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07280v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a robust framework for learning various generalized Hamiltonian dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data and in an unsupervised manner based on variational Bayesian inference. Although conservative, dissipative, and port-Hamiltonian systems might share the same initial total energy of a closed system, it is challenging for a single Hamiltonian network model to capture the distinctive and varying motion dynamics and physics of a phase space, from sampled observational phase space trajectories. To address this complicated Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge, we extend sparse symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes learning with predictive successive numerical estimations of the Hamiltonian landscape, using a generalized form of state and conjugate momentum Hamiltonian dynamics, appropriate to different classes of conservative, dissipative and port-Hamiltonian physical systems. In addition to the kernelized evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation constraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the model's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction accuracy with bounded uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajAware: Graph Cross-Attention and Trajectory-Aware for Generalisable VANETs under Partial Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06665v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are a crucial component of intelligent transportation systems; however, routing remains challenging due to dynamic topologies, incomplete observations, and the limited resources of edge devices. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often assume fixed graph structures and require retraining when network conditions change, making them unsuitable for deployment on constrained hardware. We present TrajAware, an RL-based framework designed for edge AI deployment in VANETs. TrajAware integrates three components: (i) action space pruning, which reduces redundant neighbour options while preserving two-hop reachability, alleviating the curse of dimensionality; (ii) graph cross-attention, which maps pruned neighbours to the global graph context, producing features that generalise across diverse network sizes; and (iii) trajectory-aware prediction, which uses historical routes and junction information to estimate real-time positions under partial observations. We evaluate TrajAware in the open-source SUMO simulator using real-world city maps with a leave-one-city-out setup. Results show that TrajAware achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Resident fitness computation in linear time and other algorithmic aspects of interacting trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11561v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The notion of a system of interacting trajectories was recently introduced by Hermann, Gonz\'alez Casanova, Soares dos Santos, T\'obi\'as and Wakolbinger. Such a system of $[0,1]$-valued piecewise linear trajectories arises as a scaling limit of the system of logarithmic subpopulation sizes in a population-genetic model (more precisely, a Moran model) with mutation and selection. By definition, the resident fitness is initially 0 and afterwards it increases by the ultimate slope of each trajectory that reaches height 1. We show that although the interaction of $n$ trajectories may yield $\Omega(n^2)$ slope changes in total, the resident fitness function can be computed algorithmically in $O(n)$ time. Our algorithm uses the so-called continued lines representation of the system of interacting trajectories. In the special case of Poissonian interacting trajectories where the birth times of the trajectories form a Poisson process and the initial slopes are random and i.i.d., we provide a linear bound on the expected total number of slope changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v5)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance. The code is available at https://github.com/YvanYin/GoalFlow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical description and dimension reduction of categorical trajectories with multivariate functional principal components](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09986v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are many examples in which the statistical units of interest are samples of a continuous time categorical random process, that is to say a continuous time stochastic process taking values in a finite state space. Getting simple representations that allow comparisons of a set of trajectories is of major interest for statisticians. Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical description of the categorical trajectories into a multivariate functional principal components analysis. The (multivariate) covariance operator has nice interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities and the multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, it is simple to build consistent estimators of the covariance kernel and perform multivariate functional principal components analysis. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories are not supposed to be continuous and can be observed exhaustively. The approach is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments. We also show how it can be easily extended to analyze experiments, such as temporal check-all-that-apply, in which two states or more can be observed at the same time.</p></details> |  |

This growing deployment presents new challenges for UAV trajectory planning in complex urban environments. However, existing studies often overlook key factors, such as urban airspace constraints and economic efficiency, which are essential in low-altitude economy contexts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising solution to these issues, while its practical adoption remains limited by low learning efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel UAV trajectory planning framework that combines DRL with large language model (LLM) reasoning to enable safe, compliant, and economically viable path planning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple metrics, including data collection rate, collision avoidance, successful landing, regulatory compliance, and energy efficiency. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing UAV trajectory planning key challenges under constraints of the low-altitude economy networking.</p></details> |  |

These constraints are integrated into a potential field optimization to adapt initial trajectories while preserving feasibility and safety. A multi-agent strategy further enhances robustness under complex or conflicting commands.

Increasing the number of denoising steps is the primary scaling axis, but this yields quickly diminishing returns. Instead optimizing the noise trajectory--the sequence of injected noise vectors--is promising, as the specific noise realizations critically affect sample quality; but this is challenging due to a high-dimensional search space, complex noise-outcome interactions, and costly trajectory evaluations. We address this by first casting diffusion as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a terminal reward, showing tree-search methods such as Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to be meaningful but impractical. To balance performance and efficiency, we then resort to a relaxation of MDP, where we view denoising as a sequence of independent contextual bandits. This allows us to introduce an $\epsilon$-greedy search algorithm that globally explores at extreme timesteps and locally exploits during the intermediate steps where de-mixing occurs. Experiments on EDM and Stable Diffusion reveal state-of-the-art scores for class-conditioned/text-to-image generation, exceeding baselines by up to $164\%$ and matching/exceeding MCTS performance. To our knowledge, this is the first practical method for test-time noise trajectory optimization of arbitrary (non-differentiable) rewards.</p></details> |  |
| **[MENSA: A Multi-Event Network for Survival Analysis with Trajectory-based Likelihood Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06525v4)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing time-to-event methods focus on either single-event or competing-risk settings, leaving multi-event scenarios relatively underexplored. In many real-world applications, the same patient may experience multiple events that are non-exclusive, and sometimes semi-competing. A common workaround is to train separate single-event models, but this approach fails to exploit dependencies and shared structure across events. To address these limitations, we propose MENSA (Multi-Event Network for Survival Analysis), a deep learning model that jointly models flexible time-to-event distributions for multiple events, whether competing or co-occurring. In addition, we introduce a novel trajectory-based likelihood that captures the temporal ordering between events. Across five benchmark datasets, MENSA consistently improves prediction performance over many state-of-the-art baselines.

| **[Efficient Virtuoso: A Latent Diffusion Transformer Model for Goal-Conditioned Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03658v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems. While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity, computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present the Efficient Virtuoso, a conditional latent diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, achieving a minimum Average Displacement Error (minADE) of 0.25. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Effective Trajectory Planning and an Optimized Path Planning for a 6-Degree-of-Freedom Robot Manipulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00828v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An effective method for optimizing path planning for a specific model of a 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator is presented as part of the motion planning of the manipulator using computer algebra. We assume that we are given a path in the form of a set of line segments that the end-effector should follow. We also assume that we have a method to solve the inverse kinematic problem of the manipulator at each via-point of the trajectory. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, we calculate the feasible region of the manipulator under a specific configuration of the end-effector. Next, we aim to find a trajectory on the line segments and a sequence of joint configurations the manipulator should follow to move the end-effector along the specified trajectory. Finally, we find the optimal combination of solutions to the inverse kinematic problem at each via-point along the trajectory by reducing the problem to a shortest-path problem of the graph and applying Dijkstra's algorithm. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by experiments.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Learning to Coordinate: Distributed Meta-Trajectory Optimization Via Differentiable ADMM-DDP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01630v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Acceleration Preconditioners for Parametric Radiative Transfer Equations based on Trajectory-Aware Reduced Order Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05001v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The parametric radiative transfer equation (RTE) arises in multi-query applications, such as design optimization, inverse problems, and uncertainty quantification, which require solving the RTE multiple times for various parameters. Classical synthetic acceleration (SA) preconditioners are designed based on low-order approximations of a kinetic correction equation, e.g., its diffusion limit in diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA). Despite their widespread success, these methods rely on empirical physical assumptions and do not leverage low-rank structures across parameters of the parametric problem. To address these limitations, our previous work introduced a reduced-order model (ROM) enhanced preconditioner called ROMSAD, which exploits low-rank structures across parameters and the original kinetic description of the correction equation. While ROMSAD improves overall efficiency compared with DSA, its efficiency reduces after the first iteration, because the construction of the underlying ROM ignores the preconditioner-dependence of the residual trajectory, leading to a mismatch between the offline and online residual trajectories. To overcome this issue, we introduce a trajectory-aware framework that iteratively constructs ROMs to eliminate the mismatch between offline and online residual trajectories. Numerical tests demonstrate superior efficiency over DSA, and substantial gains in both efficiency and robustness over ROMSAD. For a parametric lattice problem, trajectory-aware ROM preconditioners achieve rapid convergence within only $2$-$3$ iterations online.</p></details> | 32 pages, 9 figures |

While human-motion-centric approaches excel in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods. Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.</p></details> |  |

STO maintains the maneuver strategy of the high-level global planner while allowing curvature discontinuities at switching points to improve maneuver efficiency. To ensure safety, a convex corridor is constructed via GJK-accelerated ellipse shrinking and expansion, serving as safety constraints in each iteration. Numerical simulations in perpendicular and reverse-angled parking scenarios demonstrate that STO enhances maneuver efficiency while ensuring safety. Moreover, computational performance confirms its practicality for real-world applications.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Robust Offline Imitation Learning Through State-level Trajectory Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22524v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning (IL) has proven effective for enabling robots to acquire visuomotor skills through expert demonstrations. However, traditional IL methods are limited by their reliance on high-quality, often scarce, expert data, and suffer from covariate shift. To address these challenges, recent advances in offline IL have incorporated suboptimal, unlabeled datasets into the training. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance policy learning from mixed-quality offline datasets by leveraging task-relevant trajectory fragments and rich environmental dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a state-based search framework that stitches state-action pairs from imperfect demonstrations, generating more diverse and informative training trajectories. Experimental results on standard IL benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks showcase that our proposed method significantly improves both generalization and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can the Waymo Open Motion Dataset Support Realistic Behavioral Modeling? A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03515v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations. Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably, WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving. Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without proper validation against independently collected data.</p></details> |  |

For control purposes, the model is structured as a cascade system, where a rotational subsystem drives a translational one. The rotational subsystem is linear, while the translational subsystem follows a linear-plus-perturbation form, thereby reducing the complexity of control design. A control strategy requiring only simple operations, no memory, and no iterative search loops is presented to illustrate the main features of the GA model. By employing GA to model both translations and rotations, a singularity-free and geometrically intuitive representation can be achieved through the use of the geometric product. Closed-loop stability is rigorously established using input-to-state stability methods. Numerical simulations of a quad tilt-rotorcraft performing trajectory tracking in a windy environment validate the controller's stability and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE TAES for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[KEPT: Knowledge-Enhanced Prediction of Trajectories from Consecutive Driving Frames with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02966v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars. Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion, and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset, KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising, data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

How about solving such a problem at an incredibly fast computational time? On a small form-factor processor? Algorithmic details that make possible this trifecta of breakthroughs are presented in this paper. The computational mathematics that deliver these advancements are: (i) a Birkhoff-theoretic discretization of optimal control problems, (ii) matrix-free linear algebra leveraging Krylov-subspace methods, and (iii) a near-perfect Birkhoff preconditioner that helps achieve $\mathcal{O}(1)$ iteration speed with respect to the grid size,~$N$. A key enabler of this high performance is the computation of Birkhoff matrix-vector products at $\mathcal{O}(N\log(N))$ time using fast Fourier transform techniques that eliminate traditional computational bottlenecks. A numerical demonstration of this unprecedented scale and speed is illustrated for a practical astrodynamics problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, AAS Paper 25-689</p></details> |

Still, existing data-driven models are constrained mainly to single-vessel forecasting, overlooking vessel interactions, navigation rules, and explicit collision risk assessment. We present a transformer-based framework for multi-vessel trajectory prediction with integrated collision risk analysis. For a given target vessel, the framework identifies nearby vessels. It jointly predicts their future trajectories through parallel streams encoding kinematic and derived physical features, causal convolutions for temporal locality, spatial transformations for positional encoding, and hybrid positional embeddings that capture both local motion patterns and long-range dependencies. Evaluated on large-scale real-world AIS data using joint multi-vessel metrics, the model demonstrates superior forecasting capabilities beyond traditional single-vessel displacement errors. By simulating interactions among predicted trajectories, the framework further quantifies potential collision risks, offering actionable insights to strengthen maritime safety and decision support.</p></details> |  |

An MPC strategy based on a 12-dimensional prediction model is proposed for the outer loop, explicitly accounting for time-varying coupled constraints, where multiple variables are interdependent and need to be handled together. The outer-loop controller generates an acceleration reference, which is then converted into attitude and angular velocity references, later tracked by a nonlinear inner-loop controller. Numerical simulations validate the approach, demonstrating enhanced performance in precise and fast tracking by imposing less conservative constraints than existing approaches, while still guaranteeing stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, submitted to 2025 IEEE 64th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)</p></details> |
| **[Relative Trajectory Balance is equivalent to Trust-PCL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01632v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in generative modeling has highlighted the importance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for fine-tuning, with KL-regularized methods in particular proving to be highly effective for both autoregressive and diffusion models. Complementing this line of work, the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB) objective was recently introduced in the context of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to serve the same role of improving fine-tuning in sequential generative models. Building on prior work linking GFlowNets and maximum-entropy RL, we establish in this paper an equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL, an off-policy RL method with KL regularization. This equivalence situates RTB within the broader theoretical landscape of KL-regularized RL, and clarifies its relationship to earlier methods. Leveraging this insight, we revisit an illustrative example from the RTB paper and show that KL-regularized RL methods achieve comparable performance, offering an alternative perspective to what was previously reported.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using iterated local alignment to aggregate trajectory data into a traffic flow map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17500v6)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectories are a promising GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) data source to compute multi-scale traffic flow maps ranging from the city/regional level to the road level. The main obstacle is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for city level, large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial difficulties for road level, small-scale aggregation. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales for static and interactive maps.</p></details> |  |

While general-purpose deep research agents have shown impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored for medical contexts. We present a medical deep research agent that addresses these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool interactions. Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Metamorphic Testing of Multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01294v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Predicting human trajectories is crucial for the safety and reliability of autonomous systems, such as automated vehicles and mobile robots. However, rigorously testing the underlying multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) models, which typically use multiple input sources (e.g., trajectory history and environment maps) and produce stochastic outputs (multiple possible future paths), presents significant challenges. The primary difficulty lies in the absence of a definitive test oracle, as numerous future trajectories might be plausible for any given scenario. Objectives: This research presents the application of Metamorphic Testing (MT) as a systematic methodology for testing multimodal HTP systems. We address the oracle problem through metamorphic relations (MRs) adapted for the complexities and stochastic nature of HTP. Methods: We present five MRs, targeting transformations of both historical trajectory data and semantic segmentation maps used as an environmental context. These MRs encompass: 1) label-preserving geometric transformations (mirroring, rotation, rescaling) applied to both trajectory and map inputs, where outputs are expected to transform correspondingly. 2) Map-altering transformations (changing semantic class labels, introducing obstacles) with predictable changes in trajectory distributions. We propose probabilistic violation criteria based on distance metrics between probability distributions, such as the Wasserstein or Hellinger distance. Conclusion: This study introduces tool, a MT framework for the oracle-less testing of multimodal, stochastic HTP systems. It allows for assessment of model robustness against input transformations and contextual changes without reliance on ground-truth trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Infor...</summary><p>Information and Software Technology</p></details> |

An innovative geometric indicator, based on the analysis of safety zones using adaptive ellipses, is used to accurately quantify collision risks. Our method applies the Shoelace formula to compute the intersection area in the case of misaligned and time-varying configurations. Comfort is modeled using indicators centered on longitudinal and lateral jerk, while efficiency is assessed by overall travel time. These criteria are aggregated into a comprehensive objective function solved using a PSO based algorithm. The approach was successfully validated under real traffic conditions via experiments conducted in an urban intersection involving an autonomous vehicle interacting with a human-operated vehicle, and in simulation using data recorded from human driving in real traffic.</p></details> |  |

End-to-end methods that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association. MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition, MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

While existing trajectory planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i) a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives, providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.</p></details> |  |

Although data acquisition using drones is efficient, existing datasets still have limitations in scene representativeness, information richness, and data fidelity. This study introduces FLUID, comprising a fine-grained trajectory dataset that captures dense conflicts at typical urban signalized intersections, and a lightweight, full-pipeline framework for drone-based trajectory processing.

However, most deep learning methods either consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions. While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e. predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports $3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.</p></details> |  |

Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for generating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory.

| **[Dynamics-Compliant Trajectory Diffusion for Super-Nominal Payload Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21375v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nominal payload ratings for articulated robots are typically derived from worst-case configurations, resulting in uniform payload constraints across the entire workspace. This conservative approach severely underutilizes the robot's inherent capabilities -- our analysis demonstrates that manipulators can safely handle payloads well above nominal capacity across broad regions of their workspace while staying within joint angle, velocity, acceleration, and torque limits. To address this gap between assumed and actual capability, we propose a novel trajectory generation approach using denoising diffusion models that explicitly incorporates payload constraints into the planning process. Unlike traditional sampling-based methods that rely on inefficient trial-and-error, optimization-based methods that are prohibitively slow, or kinodynamic planners that struggle with problem dimensionality, our approach generates dynamically feasible joint-space trajectories in constant time that can be directly executed on physical hardware without post-processing. Experimental validation on a 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrates that up to 67.6% of the workspace remains accessible even with payloads exceeding 3 times the nominal capacity. This expanded operational envelope highlights the importance of a more nuanced consideration of payload dynamics in motion planning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 Conference on Robot Learning [CoRL]</p></details> |
| **[BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05762v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Manifold Trajectories in Next-Token Prediction: From Replicator Dynamics to Softmax Equilibrium](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21186v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comparative Study of Spline-Based Trajectory Reconstruction Methods Across Varying Automatic Vehicle Location Data Densities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00119v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic vehicle location (AVL) data offers insights into transit dynamics, but its effectiveness is often hampered by inconsistent update frequencies, necessitating trajectory reconstruction. This research evaluates 13 trajectory reconstruction methods, including several novel approaches, using high-resolution AVL data from Austin, Texas. We examine the interplay of four critical factors -- velocity, position, smoothing, and data density -- on reconstruction performance. A key contribution of this study is evaluation of these methods across sparse and dense datasets, providing insights into the trade-off between accuracy and resource allocation. Our evaluation framework combines traditional mathematical error metrics for positional and velocity with practical considerations, such as physical realism (e.g., aligning velocity and acceleration with stopped states, deceleration rates, and speed variability). In addition, we provide insight into the relative value of each method in calculating realistic metrics for infrastructure evaluations. Our findings indicate that velocity-aware methods consistently outperform position-only approaches. Interestingly, we discovered that smoothing-based methods can degrade overall performance in complex, congested urban environments, although enforcing monotonicity remains critical. The velocity constrained Hermite interpolation with monotonicity enforcement (VCHIP-ME) yields optimal results, offering a balance between high accuracy and computational efficiency. Its minimal overhead makes it suitable for both historical analysis and real-time applications, providing significant predictive power when combined with dense datasets. These findings offer practical guidance for researchers and practitioners implementing trajectory reconstruction systems and emphasize the importance of investing in higher-frequency AVL data collection for improved analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeMat-Traj: A Scalable and Unified Dataset of Materials Trajectories for Atomistic Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20875v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs. LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LeMaterial/LeMat-Traj and https://github.com/LeMaterial/lematerial-fetcher.</p></details> |  |

However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher.

The investigation of these dynamics can provide a better understanding of diffusing objects and their surrounding media, but a quantitative characterization from individual trajectories is often challenging. Efforts devoted to improving anomalous diffusion detection using classical statistics and machine learning have produced several new methods. Recently, the anomalous diffusion challenge (AnDi, www.andi-challenge.org) was launched to objectively assess these approaches on a common dataset, focusing on three aspects of anomalous diffusion: the inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent; the classification of the diffusion model; and the segmentation of trajectories. In this article, I describe a simple approach to tackle the tasks of the AnDi challenge by combining extreme learning machine and feature engineering (AnDi-ELM). The method reaches satisfactory performance while offering a straightforward implementation and fast training time with limited computing resources, making it a suitable tool for fast preliminary screening of anomalous diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Ego-centric Predictive Model Conditioned on Hand Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19852v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In egocentric scenarios, anticipating both the next action and its visual outcome is essential for understanding human-object interactions and for enabling robotic planning. However, existing paradigms fall short of jointly modeling these aspects. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models focus on action prediction but lack explicit modeling of how actions influence the visual scene, while video prediction models generate future frames without conditioning on specific actions, often resulting in implausible or contextually inconsistent outcomes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified two-stage predictive framework that jointly models action and visual future in egocentric scenarios, conditioned on hand trajectories. In the first stage, we perform consecutive state modeling to process heterogeneous inputs (visual observations, language, and action history) and explicitly predict future hand trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce causal cross-attention to fuse multi-modal cues, leveraging inferred action signals to guide an image-based Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for frame-by-frame future video generation. Our approach is the first unified model designed to handle both egocentric human activity understanding and robotic manipulation tasks, providing explicit predictions of both upcoming actions and their visual consequences. Extensive experiments on Ego4D, BridgeData, and RLBench demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both action prediction and future video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: github.com/showlab/Ego-PM</p></details> |
| **[UAV-UGV Cooperative Trajectory Optimization and Task Allocation for Medical Rescue Tasks in Post-Disaster Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06136v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In post-disaster scenarios, rapid and efficient delivery of medical resources is critical and challenging due to severe damage to infrastructure. To provide an optimized solution, we propose a cooperative trajectory optimization and task allocation framework leveraging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). This study integrates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for efficient task allocation among multiple UAVs and UGVs, and employs an informed-RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star) algorithm for collision-free trajectory generation. Further optimization of task sequencing and path efficiency is conducted using Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Simulation experiments conducted in a realistic post-disaster environment demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves the overall efficiency of medical rescue operations compared to traditional strategies. Specifically, our method reduces the total mission completion time to 26.7 minutes for a 15-task scenario, outperforming K-Means clustering and random allocation by over 73%. Furthermore, the framework achieves a substantial 15.1% reduction in total traveled distance after CMA-ES optimization. The cooperative utilization of UAVs and UGVs effectively balances their complementary advantages, highlighting the system's scalability and practicality for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Trust Region Sequential Convex Optimization for Multi-Drone Thermal Screening Trajectory Planning in Urban Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06012v3)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid detection of abnormal body temperatures in urban populations is essential for managing public health risks, especially during outbreaks of infectious diseases. Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance, coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas.

| **[Coresets from Trajectories: Selecting Data via Correlation of Loss Differences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20230v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k, CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with <1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints, incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled, efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion: Real-Time Trajectory Planning with Just-Enough Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12166v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots equipped with rich sensor suites can localize reliably in partially-observable environments, but powering every sensor continuously is wasteful and often infeasible. Belief-space planners address this by propagating pose-belief covariance through analytic models and switching sensors heuristically--a brittle, runtime-expensive approach. Data-driven approaches--including diffusion models--learn multi-modal trajectories from demonstrations, but presuppose an accurate, always-on state estimate. We address the largely open problem: for a given task in a mapped environment, which \textit{minimal sensor subset} must be active at each location to maintain state uncertainty \textit{just low enough} to complete the task? Our key insight is that when a diffusion planner is explicitly conditioned on a pose-belief raster and a sensor mask, the spread of its denoising trajectories yields a calibrated, differentiable proxy for the expected localisation error. Building on this insight, we present Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion (B-COD), the first planner that, in a 10 ms forward pass, returns a short-horizon trajectory, per-waypoint aleatoric variances, and a proxy for localisation error--eliminating external covariance rollouts. We show that this single proxy suffices for a soft-actor-critic to choose sensors online, optimising energy while bounding pose-covariance growth. We deploy B-COD in real-time marine trials on an unmanned surface vehicle and show that it reduces sensing energy consumption while matching the goal-reach performance of an always-on baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025 (Conference on Robot Learning)</p></details> |

The task of predicting pedestrian crossing intention involves determining whether pedestrians in the scene are likely to cross the road or not. In this work, we propose TrajFusionNet, a novel transformer-based model that combines future pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed predictions as priors for predicting crossing intention. TrajFusionNet comprises two branches: a Sequence Attention Module (SAM) and a Visual Attention Module (VAM). The SAM branch learns from a sequential representation of the observed and predicted pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed. Complementarily, the VAM branch enables learning from a visual representation of the predicted pedestrian trajectory by overlaying predicted pedestrian bounding boxes onto scene images. By utilizing a small number of lightweight modalities, TrajFusionNet achieves the lowest total inference time (including model runtime and data preprocessing) among current state-of-the-art approaches. In terms of performance, it achieves state-of-the-art results across the three most commonly used datasets for pedestrian crossing intention prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[GTPO: Trajectory-Based Policy Optimization in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03772v3)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces the Trajectory-to-Action Pipeline (TAP), a scalable and automated method for extracting SDL labels from large trajectory datasets. TAP applies a rules-based cross-entropy optimization approach to learn parameters directly from data, enhancing generalization across diverse driving contexts. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), TAP achieves 30% greater precision than Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 24% over Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in identifying behaviorally similar trajectories. Additionally, TAP enables automated detection of unique driving behaviors, streamlining safety evaluation processes for AV testing. This work provides a foundation for scalable scenario-based AV behavior analysis, with potential extensions for integrating multi-agent contexts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Medical doctors guide these conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a significant boost in performance.

By segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process. To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change, motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single, single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200 frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space design validation in crowd dynamics research.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we consider a single UAV with 3 degree-of-freedom dynamics tasked with delivering blood packages to multiple hospitals, each with a predefined time window and priority. Mission objectives are encoded using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enabling the formal specification of spatial-temporal constraints. To ensure safety, city buildings are modeled as 3D convex obstacles, and obstacle avoidance is handled through a Convex Feasible Set (CFS) method. The entire planning problem-combining UAV dynamics, STL satisfaction, and collision avoidance-is formulated as a convex optimization problem that ensures tractability and can be solved efficiently using standard convex programming techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method generates dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories that satisfy temporal mission goals, providing a scalable and reliable approach for autonomous UAV-based medical logistics.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

However, it is challenging to cooperatively deploy multiple UAV swarms in large-scale remote areas. Hence, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical UAV swarms structure for 6G aerial access networks, where the head UAVs serve as aerial BSs, and tail UAVs (T-UAVs) are responsible for relay. In detail, we jointly optimize the dynamic deployment and trajectory of UAV swarms, which is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) to concurrently minimize the energy consumption of UAV swarms and GUs, as well as the delay of GUs. However, the proposed MOP is a mixed integer nonlinear programming and NP-hard to solve. Therefore, we develop a K-means and Voronoi diagram based area division method, and construct Fermat points to establish connections between GUs and T-UAVs. Then, an improved non-dominated sorting whale optimization algorithm is proposed to seek Pareto optimal solutions for the transformed MOP. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to verify the performance of proposed algorithms by comparing with baseline mechanisms, resulting in a 50% complexity reduction.</p></details> |  |

Our framework features a unified trajectory representation that encapsulates the kinematic models of both $SO(3)\times\mathbb{R}^3$ and $SE(3)$ pose representations. This encapsulation strategy allows users to use the same implementation of measurement-based factors for either choice of pose representation, which facilitates experimentation and comparison to achieve the best model for the ME task. In addition, unique to our framework, we derive the kinematic models with the closed-form temporal derivatives of the local variable of $SO(3)$ and $SE(3)$, which so far has only been approximated based on the Taylor expansion in the literature. Our experiments show that these kinematic models can improve the estimation accuracy in high-speed scenarios. All analytical Jacobians of the interpolated states with respect to the support states of the trajectory representation, as well as the motion prior factors, are also provided for accelerated Gauss-Newton (GN) optimization. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the framework in various motion estimation tasks such as localization, calibration, and odometry, facilitating fast prototyping for ME researchers.

Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved promising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual manipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual manipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and objects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and objects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of diffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM) to schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding pairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically generated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase in success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world tasks further verify its practical value by improving the success rate by 32.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website is at: https://denghaoyuan123.github.io/SafeBimanip/</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce the FlexiSteps Network (FSN), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts prediction output time steps based on varying contextual conditions. Inspired by recent advancements addressing observation length discrepancies and dynamic feature extraction, FSN incorporates an pre-trained Adaptive Prediction Module (APM) to evaluate and adjust the output steps dynamically, ensuring optimal prediction accuracy and efficiency. To guarantee the plug-and-play of our FSN, we also design a Dynamic Decoder(DD). Additionally, to balance the prediction time steps and prediction accuracy, we design a scoring mechanism, which not only introduces the Fr\'echet distance to evaluate the geometric similarity between the predicted trajectories and the ground truth trajectories but the length of predicted steps is also considered. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including Argoverse and INTERACTION demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed FSN framework.</p></details> |  |

However, existing works suffer from the generalization problem, \ie, they are either restricted to train for specific regions or only suitable for a few tasks. Given the recent advances of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we raise the question: can MLLMs reform current trajectory data mining and solve the problem? Nevertheless, due to the modality gap of trajectory, how to generate task-independent multimodal trajectory representations and how to adapt flexibly to different tasks remain the foundational challenges. In this paper, we propose \texttt{Traj-MLLM}}, which is the first general framework using MLLMs for trajectory data mining. By integrating multiview contexts, \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} transforms raw trajectories into interleaved image-text sequences while preserving key spatial-temporal characteristics, and directly utilizes the reasoning ability of MLLMs for trajectory analysis. Additionally, a prompt optimization method is proposed to finalize data-invariant prompts for task adaptation. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets show that \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by $48.05\%$, $15.52\%$, $51.52\%$, $1.83\%$ on travel time estimation, mobility prediction, anomaly detection and transportation mode identification, respectively. \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} achieves these superior performances without requiring any training data or fine-tuning the MLLM backbones.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |
| **[OmniCache: A Trajectory-Oriented Global Perspective on Training-Free Cache Reuse for Diffusion Transformer Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16212v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process. Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the sampling procedure. In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Preference Trajectory Modeling via Flow Matching for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17618v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation predicts each user's next item based on their historical interaction sequence. Recently, diffusion models have attracted significant attention in this area due to their strong ability to model user interest distributions. They typically generate target items by denoising Gaussian noise conditioned on historical interactions. However, these models face two critical limitations. First, they exhibit high sensitivity to the condition, making it difficult to recover target items from pure Gaussian noise. Second, the inference process is computationally expensive, limiting practical deployment. To address these issues, we propose FlowRec, a simple yet effective sequential recommendation framework which leverages flow matching to explicitly model user preference trajectories from current states to future interests. Flow matching is an emerging generative paradigm, which offers greater flexibility in initial distributions and enables more efficient sampling. Based on this, we construct a personalized behavior-based prior distribution to replace Gaussian noise and learn a vector field to model user preference trajectories. To better align flow matching with the recommendation objective, we further design a single-step alignment loss incorporating both positive and negative samples, improving sampling efficiency and generation quality. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify the superiority of FlowRec over the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02085v5)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/JARVIS-Xs/SE-Agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReviBranch: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Branch-and-Bound with Revived Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17452v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm is the main solver for Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs), where the selection of branching variable is essential to computational efficiency. However, traditional heuristics for branching often fail to generalize across heterogeneous problem instances, while existing learning-based methods such as imitation learning (IL) suffers from dependence on expert demonstration quality, and reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with limitations in sparse rewards and dynamic state representation challenges. To address these issues, we propose ReviBranch, a novel deep RL framework that constructs revived trajectories by reviving explicit historical correspondences between branching decisions and their corresponding graph states along search-tree paths. During training, ReviBranch enables agents to learn from complete structural evolution and temporal dependencies within the branching process. Additionally, we introduce an importance-weighted reward redistribution mechanism that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense stepwise feedback, addressing the sparse reward challenge. Extensive experiments on different MILP benchmarks demonstrate that ReviBranch outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, reducing B&B nodes by 4.0% and LP iterations by 2.2% on large-scale instances. The results highlight the robustness and generalizability of ReviBranch across heterogeneous MILP problem classes.</p></details> | conference |

Natural language enables users to express these adjustments in an interactive manner. We introduce OVITA, an interpretable, open-vocabulary, language-driven framework designed for adapting robot trajectories in dynamic and novel situations based on human instructions. OVITA leverages multiple pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate user commands into trajectories generated by motion planners or those learned through demonstrations. OVITA employs code as an adaptation policy generated by an LLM, enabling users to adjust individual waypoints, thus providing flexible control. Another LLM, which acts as a code explainer, removes the need for expert users, enabling intuitive interactions. The efficacy and significance of the proposed OVITA framework is demonstrated through extensive simulations and real-world environments with diverse tasks involving spatiotemporal variations on heterogeneous robotic platforms such as a KUKA IIWA robot manipulator, Clearpath Jackal ground robot, and CrazyFlie drone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics and Automation Letters 2025.

Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG) representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF) design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups, and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving high fidelity along the original trajectory.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Rapid Iterative Trajectory Planning Method for Automated Parking through Differential Flatness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17038v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous driving continues to advance, automated parking is becoming increasingly essential. However, significant challenges arise when implementing path velocity decomposition (PVD) trajectory planning for automated parking. The primary challenge is ensuring rapid and precise collision-free trajectory planning, which is often in conflict. The secondary challenge involves maintaining sufficient control feasibility of the planned trajectory, particularly at gear shifting points (GSP). This paper proposes a PVD-based rapid iterative trajectory planning (RITP) method to solve the above challenges. The proposed method effectively balances the necessity for time efficiency and precise collision avoidance through a novel collision avoidance framework. Moreover, it enhances the overall control feasibility of the planned trajectory by incorporating the vehicle kinematics model and including terminal smoothing constraints (TSC) at GSP during path planning. Specifically, the proposed method leverages differential flatness to ensure the planned path adheres to the vehicle kinematic model. Additionally, it utilizes TSC to maintain curvature continuity at GSP, thereby enhancing the control feasibility of the overall trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate superior time efficiency and tracking errors compared to model-integrated and other iteration-based trajectory planning methods. In the real-world experiment, the proposed method was implemented and validated on a ROS-based vehicle, demonstrating the applicability of the RITP method for real vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the journal Robotics and Autonomous Systems</p></details> |

The framework is built upon Large Language Models (LLMs), incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowered by Agentic AI and integrated with a UAV-specific knowledge base. Through the Agentic RAG, the LLM autonomously interprets high-level task requirements and identifies the key components necessary for trajectory optimization, including model inputs and outputs, network architecture, reward functions, and task constraints. To support efficient modeling across different system scales, we introduce the Mamba-Attention Integrated Transformer (MAIT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines the long-range dependency modeling capability of attention mechanisms with the efficient temporal dynamic representation of Mamba. Furthermore, a Trajectory-Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) method is proposed to achieve unified policy gradient optimization in both discrete and continuous trajectory spaces for MAIT training. Extensive experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ARMAIT framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrated Take-off Management and Trajectory Optimization for Merging Control in Urban Air Mobility Corridors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15395v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has the potential to revolutionize daily transportation, offering rapid and efficient aerial mobility services. Take-off and merging phases are critical for air corridor operations, requiring the coordination of take-off aircraft and corridor traffic while ensuring safety and seamless transition. This paper proposes an integrated take-off management and trajectory optimization for merging control in UAM corridors. We first introduce a novel take-off airspace design. To our knowledge, this paper is one of the first to propose a structured design for take-off airspace. Based on the take-off airspace design, we devise a hierarchical coordinated take-off and merging management (HCTMM) strategy. To be specific, the take-off airspace design can simplify aircraft dynamics and thus reduce the dimensionality of the trajectory optimization problem whilst mitigating obstacle avoidance complexities. The HCTMM strategy strictly ensures safety and improves the efficiency of take-off and merging operations. At the tactical level, a scheduling algorithm coordinates aircraft take-off times and selects dynamic merging points to reduce conflicts and ensure smooth take-off and merging processes. At the operational level, a trajectory optimization strategy ensures that each aircraft reaches the dynamic merging point efficiently while satisfying safety constraints. Simulation results show that, compared to representative strategies with fixed or dynamic merging points, the HCTMM strategy significantly improves operational efficiency and reduces computational burden, while ensuring safety under various corridor traffic conditions. Further results confirm the scalability of the HCTMM strategy and the computational efficiency enabled by the proposed take-off airspace design.</p></details> | 31 pages |

Most models predict chronological age, an imperfect surrogate for biological aging, or generate synthetic MRIs that enhance data diversity but fail to capture subject-specific trajectories. Here, we present BrainPath, a 3D generative framework that learns longitudinal brain aging dynamics during training and, at inference, predicts anatomically faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan. BrainPath integrates an age calibration loss, a swap learning strategy, and an age perceptual loss to preserve subtle, biologically meaningful variations. Across held-out ADNI and an independent NACC dataset, BrainPath outperforms state-of-the-art reference models in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns. Beyond methodological innovation, BrainPath enables personalized mapping of brain aging, synthetic follow-up scan prediction, and trajectory-based analyses, providing a foundation for precision modeling of brain aging and supporting research into neurodegeneration and aging interventions.</p></details> |  |

A custom simulation incorporating realistic waves and current disturbances is developed to validate the controller's performance, supported by further validation through field tests in the harbour of Scheveningen, the Netherlands, and at sea. Simulation results demonstrate that ADRC significantly reduces cross-track error across all tested conditions compared to a baseline PID controller but increases control effort and energy consumption. Field trials confirm these findings while revealing a further increase in energy consumption during sea trials compared to the baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at IROS 2025.

To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided hierarchical planning framework for robust spatial-temporal obstacle avoidance. In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance and fast parallel computation. Furthermore, an incremental multi-branch trajectory management framework is introduced to enable spatio-temporal topological decision-making, while efficiently leveraging historical information to reduce replanning time. Simulation results show that TRUST-Planner outperforms baseline competitors, achieving a 96\% success rate and millisecond-level computation efficiency in tested complex environments. Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Even though most traffic accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention, as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions -- and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.</p></details> |  |

Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and most existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by UAI 2025.

The objective is to assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the reliability of the approaches. While previous VTP models overlook the specific traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be guaranteed. These findings can inform the development of more reliable vessel trajectory prediction approaches, enhancing safety and efficiency in future inland waterways navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |

The deep Koopman operator is trained on sampled flight data to construct a high-dimensional latent representation in which the nonlinear quadrotor dynamics are approximated by linear models. This linearization enables the application of MPC to efficiently optimize control actions over a finite prediction horizon, ensuring accurate trajectory tracking and stabilization. The proposed DK-MPC approach is validated through a series of trajectory-following and point-stabilization numerical experiments, where it demonstrates superior tracking accuracy and significantly lower computation time compared to conventional nonlinear MPC. These results highlight the potential of Koopman-based learning methods to handle complex quadrotor dynamics while meeting the real-time requirements of embedded flight control. Future work will focus on extending the framework to more agile flight scenarios and improving robustness against external disturbances.</p></details> |  |

We introduce BiND (Bimanual Neural Discriminator-Decoder), a two-stage model that first classifies motion type (unimanual left, unimanual right, or bimanual) and then uses specialized GRU-based decoders, augmented with a trial-relative time index, to predict continuous 2D hand velocities. We benchmark BiND against six state-of-the-art models (SVR, XGBoost, FNN, CNN, Transformer, GRU) on a publicly available 13-session intracortical dataset from a tetraplegic patient. BiND achieves a mean $R^2$ of 0.76 ($\pm$0.01) for unimanual and 0.69 ($\pm$0.03) for bimanual trajectory prediction, surpassing the next-best model (GRU) by 2% in both tasks. It also demonstrates greater robustness to session variability than all other benchmarked models, with accuracy improvements of up to 4% compared to GRU in cross-session analyses. This highlights the effectiveness of task-aware discrimination and temporal modeling in enhancing bimanual decoding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Neural Engineering (NER) Conference'25</p></details> |

Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world Argoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark comparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2025 IEEE.

| **[Towards Explainable Job Title Matching: Leveraging Semantic Textual Relatedness and Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09522v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) captures nuanced relationships between texts that extend beyond superficial lexical similarity. In this study, we investigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in resume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or misleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that evaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data stratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions: low, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables a fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful subspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG integration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT models augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR region, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings highlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also the importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model behavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by global metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human Resources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and contextual matching are essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Database Views as Explanations for Relational Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09482v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of deep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based on heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph transformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and links (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical expression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it hard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available data to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for explaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where explanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database that mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global abductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash, Segoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between determinacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of granularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones highlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of tuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case of hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive search over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are model-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of learnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical study on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different record-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed explanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoSE: Unveiling Structural Patterns in Graphs via Mixture of Subgraph Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09337v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in learning from graph-structured data, their reliance on local, pairwise message passing restricts their ability to capture complex, high-order subgraph patterns. leading to insufficient structural expressiveness. Recent efforts have attempted to enhance structural expressiveness by integrating random walk kernels into GNNs. However, these methods are inherently designed for graph-level tasks, which limits their applicability to other downstream tasks such as node classification. Moreover, their fixed kernel configurations hinder the model's flexibility in capturing diverse subgraph structures. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts (MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. We further provide a theoretical analysis of MoSE's expressivity within the Subgraph Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) Test, proving that it is more powerful than SWL. Extensive experiments, together with visualizations of learned subgraph experts, demonstrate that MoSE not only outperforms competitive baselines but also provides interpretable insights into structural patterns learned by the model.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL, with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score. Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Graph Neural Networks for Robustness in Olfaction Sensors and Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00455v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic odour source localization (OSL) is a critical capability for autonomous systems operating in complex environments. However, current OSL methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation to enhance odour localization accuracy that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines. This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and training methods, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors, enabling them to detect more compounds and inform better hardware design. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making through better sensor selection for a target compound in critical applications such as explosives detection, narcotics screening, and search and rescue.

The main novelty of CryptGNN is its secure message passing and feature transformation layers using distributed secure multi-party computation (SMPC) techniques. CryptGNN protects the client's input data and graph structure from the cloud provider and the third-party model owner, and it protects the model parameters from the cloud provider and the clients. CryptGNN works with any number of SMPC parties, does not require a trusted server, and is provably secure even if P-1 out of P parties in the cloud collude. Theoretical analysis and empirical experiments demonstrate the security and efficiency of CryptGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Inventory Networks: Toward Reliable Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11246v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We argue that inventory management presents unique opportunities for the reliable application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). To enable this, we emphasize and test two complementary techniques. The first is Hindsight Differentiable Policy Optimization (HDPO), which uses pathwise gradients from offline counterfactual simulations to directly and efficiently optimize policy performance. Unlike standard policy gradient methods that rely on high-variance score-function estimators, HDPO computes gradients by differentiating through the known system dynamics. Via extensive benchmarking, we show that HDPO recovers near-optimal policies in settings with known or bounded optima, is more robust than variants of the REINFORCE algorithm, and significantly outperforms generalized newsvendor heuristics on problems using real time series data. Our second technique aligns neural policy architectures with the topology of the inventory network. We exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a natural inductive bias for encoding supply chain structure, demonstrate that they can represent optimal and near-optimal policies in two theoretical settings, and empirically show that they reduce data requirements across six diverse inventory problems. A key obstacle to progress in this area is the lack of standardized benchmark problems. To address this gap, we open-source a suite of benchmark environments, along with our full codebase, to promote transparency and reproducibility. All resources are available at github.com/MatiasAlvo/Neural_inventory_control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Belief-State Policy Learning for Quantum Network Routing Under Decoherence and Time-Varying Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08654v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a feature-based Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework for quantum network routing, combining belief-state planning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to address partial observability, decoherence, and scalability challenges in dynamic quantum systems. Our approach encodes complex quantum network dynamics, including entanglement degradation and time-varying channel noise, into a low-dimensional feature space, enabling efficient belief updates and scalable policy learning. The core of our framework is a hybrid GNN-POMDP architecture that processes graph-structured representations of entangled links to learn routing policies, coupled with a noise-adaptive mechanism that fuses POMDP belief updates with GNN outputs for robust decision making. We provide a theoretical analysis establishing guarantees for belief convergence, policy improvement, and robustness to noise. Experiments on simulated quantum networks with up to 100 nodes demonstrate significant improvements in routing fidelity and entanglement delivery rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under high decoherence and nonstationary conditions.</p></details> |  |

We introduce second-order tensorial partial differential equations on graphs (So-TPDEGs) and propose the first theoretically grounded framework for second-order continuous product graph neural networks. Our method exploits the separability of cosine kernels in Cartesian product graphs to enable efficient spectral decomposition while preserving high-frequency signals. We further provide rigorous analyses of stability under graph perturbations and over-smoothing, establishing a solid theoretical foundation for continuous graph learning.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |

Machine learning (ML) potentials that predict energies from crystal structures are promising, but existing methods face computational bottlenecks. Steerable graph neural networks (GNNs) encode geometry with spherical harmonics, respecting atomic symmetries -- permutation, rotation, and translation -- for physically realistic predictions. Yet maintaining equivariance is difficult: activation functions must be modified, and each layer must handle multiple data types for different harmonic orders. We present Facet, a GNN architecture for efficient ML potentials, developed through systematic analysis of steerable GNNs. Our innovations include replacing expensive multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for interatomic distances with splines, which match performance while cutting computational and memory demands. We also introduce a general-purpose equivariant layer that mixes node information via spherical grid projection followed by standard MLPs -- faster than tensor products and more expressive than linear or gate layers. On the MPTrj dataset, Facet matches leading models with far fewer parameters and under 10% of their training compute. On a crystal relaxation task, it runs twice as fast as MACE models. We further show SevenNet-0's parameters can be reduced by over 25% with no accuracy loss. These techniques enable more than 10x faster training of large-scale foundation models for ML potentials, potentially reshaping computational materials discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Robustness of Link Sign Prediction in Signed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10590v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signed graphs serve as fundamental data structures for representing positive and negative relationships in social networks, with signed graph neural networks (SGNNs) emerging as the primary tool for their analysis. Our investigation reveals that balance theory, while essential for modeling signed relationships in SGNNs, inadvertently introduces exploitable vulnerabilities to black-box attacks. To showcase this, we propose balance-attack, a novel adversarial strategy specifically designed to compromise graph balance degree, and develop an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve the associated NP-hard optimization problem. While existing approaches attempt to restore attacked graphs through balance learning techniques, they face a critical challenge we term "Irreversibility of Balance-related Information," as restored edges fail to align with original attack targets. To address this limitation, we introduce Balance Augmented-Signed Graph Contrastive Learning (BA-SGCL), an innovative framework that combines contrastive learning with balance augmentation techniques to achieve robust graph representations. By maintaining high balance degree in the latent space, BA-SGCL not only effectively circumvents the irreversibility challenge but also significantly enhances model resilience. Extensive experiments across multiple SGNN architectures and real-world datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness of our proposed balance-attack and the superior robustness of BA-SGCL, advancing the security and reliability of signed graph analysis in social networks. Datasets and codes of the proposed framework are at the github repository https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BA-SGCL-submit-DF41/.</p></details> |  |
| **[MSRFormer: Road Network Representation Learning using Multi-scale Feature Fusion of Heterogeneous Spatial Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05685v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer, MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections, which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow heterogeneity of spatial interactions.</p></details> |  |

| **[Safeguarding Graph Neural Networks against Topology Inference Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05429v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning from graph-structured data. However, their widespread adoption has raised serious privacy concerns. While prior research has primarily focused on edge-level privacy, a critical yet underexplored threat lies in topology privacy - the confidentiality of the graph's overall structure. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on topology privacy risks in GNNs, revealing their vulnerability to graph-level inference attacks. To this end, we propose a suite of Topology Inference Attacks (TIAs) that can reconstruct the structure of a target training graph using only black-box access to a GNN model. Our findings show that GNNs are highly susceptible to these attacks, and that existing edge-level differential privacy mechanisms are insufficient as they either fail to mitigate the risk or severely compromise model accuracy. To address this challenge, we introduce Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR), a novel defense framework designed to protect topology privacy while maintaining model accuracy. PGR is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, where a synthetic training graph is iteratively generated using meta-gradients, and the GNN model is concurrently updated based on the evolving graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PGR significantly reduces topology leakage with minimal impact on model accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/JeffffffFu/PGR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accte...</summary><p>Acctepted by ACM CCS'25</p></details> |
| **[IBN: An Interpretable Bidirectional-Modeling Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Variable Missing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07725v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) often faces challenges from missing variables, which hinder conventional spatial-temporal graph neural networks in modeling inter-variable correlations. While GinAR addresses variable missing using attention-based imputation and adaptive graph learning for the first time, it lacks interpretability and fails to capture more latent temporal patterns due to its simple recursive units (RUs). To overcome these limitations, we propose the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN), integrating Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) and Gaussian kernel-based Graph Convolution (GGCN). IBN estimates the uncertainty of reconstructed values using MC Dropout and applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to mitigate high-risk reconstructions. GGCN explicitly models spatial correlations among variables, while a bidirectional RU enhances temporal dependency modeling. Extensive experiments show that IBN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing a more reliable and interpretable framework for MTSF with missing variables.

However, the coexistence of distinct vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) connectivity requirements, together with highly dynamic and heterogeneous network topologies, presents significant challenges for unified reliability modeling and resource optimization. To address these issues, we propose VariSAC, a graph neural network (GNN)-augmented deep reinforcement learning framework for assured, time-continuous connectivity in RIS-assisted, ISAC-enabled vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems. Specifically, we introduce the Continuous Connectivity Ratio (CCR), a unified metric that characterizes the sustained temporal reliability of V2I connections and the probabilistic delivery guarantees of V2V links, thus unifying their continuous reliability semantics. Next, we employ a GNN with residual adapters to encode complex, high-dimensional system states, capturing spatial dependencies among vehicles, base stations (BS), and RIS nodes. These representations are then processed by a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agent, which jointly optimizes channel allocation, power control, and RIS configurations to maximize CCR-driven long-term rewards. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets demonstrate that VariSAC consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of continuous V2I ISAC connectivity and V2V delivery reliability, enabling persistent connectivity in highly dynamic vehicular environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepGraphLog for Layered Neurosymbolic AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07665v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) aims to integrate the statistical strengths of neural networks with the interpretability and structure of symbolic reasoning. However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible framework for neural-symbolic integration.</p></details> |  |

However, the classical NL models are restricted by their limited representation capability and handcrafted utility specification. While researchers introduced deep neural networks (DNNs) to tackle such challenges, the existing DNNs cannot explicitly capture inter-alternative correlations in the discrete choice context. To address the challenges, this study proposes a novel concept - alternative graph - to represent the relationships among travel mode alternatives. Using a nested alternative graph, this study further designs a nested-utility graph neural network (NestGNN) as a generalization of the classical NL model in the neural network family. Theoretically, NestGNNs generalize the classical NL models and existing DNNs in terms of model representation, while retaining the crucial two-layer substitution patterns of the NL models: proportional substitution within a nest but non-proportional substitution beyond a nest. Empirically, we find that the NestGNNs significantly outperform the benchmark models, particularly the corresponding NL models by 9.2\%. As shown by elasticity tables and substitution visualization, NestGNNs retain the two-layer substitution patterns as the NL model, and yet presents more flexibility in its model design space. Overall, our study demonstrates the power of NestGNN in prediction, interpretation, and its flexibility of generalizing the classical NL model for analyzing travel mode choice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous Message Passing for Addressing Oversquashing in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06777v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from Oversquashing, which occurs when tasks require long-range interactions. The problem arises from the presence of bottlenecks that limit the propagation of messages among distant nodes. Recently, graph rewiring methods modify edge connectivity and are expected to perform well on long-range tasks. Yet, graph rewiring compromises the inductive bias, incurring significant information loss in solving the downstream task. Furthermore, increasing channel capacity may overcome information bottlenecks but enhance the parameter complexity of the model. To alleviate these shortcomings, we propose an efficient model-agnostic framework that asynchronously updates node features, unlike traditional synchronous message passing GNNs. Our framework creates node batches in every layer based on the node centrality values. The features of the nodes belonging to these batches will only get updated. Asynchronous message updates process information sequentially across layers, avoiding simultaneous compression into fixed-capacity channels. We also theoretically establish that our proposed framework maintains higher feature sensitivity bounds compared to standard synchronous approaches. Our framework is applied to six standard graph datasets and two long-range datasets to perform graph classification and achieves impressive performances with a $5\%$ and $4\%$ improvements on REDDIT-BINARY and Peptides-struct, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Composite-Loss Graph Neural Network for the Multivariate Post-Processing of Ensemble Weather Forecasts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02784v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensemble forecasting systems have advanced meteorology by providing probabilistic estimates of future states. Nonetheless, systematic biases often persist, making statistical post-processing essential. Traditional parametric post-processing techniques and machine learning-based methods can produce calibrated predictive distributions at specific locations and lead times, yet often struggle to capture dependencies across forecast dimensions. To address this, multivariate post-processing methods-such as ensemble copula coupling and the Schaake shuffle-are widely applied in a second step to restore realistic inter-variable or spatio-temporal dependencies. The aim of this study is the multivariate post-processing of ensemble forecasts using a graph neural network (dualGNN) trained with a composite loss function that combines the energy score (ES) and the variogram score (VS). The method is evaluated on two datasets: WRF-based solar irradiance forecasts over northern Chile and ECMWF visibility forecasts for Central Europe. The dualGNN consistently outperforms all empirical copula-based post-processed forecasts and shows significant improvements compared to graph neural networks trained solely on either the continuous ranked probability score or the ES, according to the evaluated multivariate verification metrics. Furthermore, for the WRF forecasts, the rank-order structure of the dualGNN forecasts captures valuable dependency information, enabling a more effective restoration of spatial relationships than either the raw numerical weather prediction ensemble or historical observational rank structures. Notably, incorporating VS into the loss function improved the univariate performance for both target variables compared to training on ES alone. Moreover, for the visibility forecasts, the ES-VS combination even outperformed the strongest calibrated reference in terms of univariate performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 16 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range interactions are captured through a flexible spectral domain parameterization. This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Load Balancing with GNN in MPTCP-Enabled Heterogeneous Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17118v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks are a promising paradigm of heterogeneous network (HetNet), attributed to the complementary physical properties of optical spectra and radio frequency. However, the current development of such HetNets is mostly bottlenecked by the existing transmission control protocol (TCP), which restricts the user equipment (UE) to connecting one access point (AP) at a time. While the ongoing investigation on multipath TCP (MPTCP) can bring significant benefits, it complicates the network topology of HetNets, making the existing load balancing (LB) learning models less effective. Driven by this, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based model to tackle the LB problem for MPTCP-enabled HetNets, which results in a partial mesh topology. Such a topology can be modeled as a graph, with the channel state information and data rate requirement embedded as node features, while the LB solutions are deemed as edge labels. Compared to the conventional deep neural network (DNN), the proposed GNN-based model exhibits two key strengths: i) it can better interpret a complex network topology; and ii) it can handle various numbers of APs and UEs with a single trained model. Simulation results show that against the traditional optimisation method, the proposed learning model can achieve near-optimal throughput within a gap of 11.5%, while reducing the inference time by 4 orders of magnitude. In contrast to the DNN model, the new method can improve the network throughput by up to 21.7%, at a similar inference time level.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wo...</summary><p>We would like to withdraw this submission because it contains several errors that need substantial revision.

A critical aspect of real-world graphs is their dynamic nature, where new nodes are continually added and existing connections may change over time. Previous theoretical studies, largely based on the transductive learning framework, fail to adequately model such temporal evolution and structural dynamics. In this paper, we presents a PAC-Bayesian theoretical analysis of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for inductive node classification, treating nodes as dependent and non-identically distributed data points. We derive novel generalization bounds for one-layer GCNs that explicitly incorporate the effects of data dependency and non-stationarity, and establish sufficient conditions under which the generalization gap converges to zero as the number of nodes increases. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to two-layer GCNs, and reveal that it requires stronger assumptions on graph topology to guarantee convergence. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding and improving GNN generalization in dynamic graph environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topological Regularization for Force Prediction in Active Particle Suspension with EGNN and Persistent Homology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06574v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capturing the dynamics of active particles, i.e., small self-propelled agents that both deform and are deformed by a fluid in which they move is a formidable problem as it requires coupling fine scale hydrodynamics with large scale collective effects. So we present a multi-scale framework that combines the three learning-driven tools to learn in concert within one pipeline. We use high-resolution Lattice Boltzmann snapshots of fluid velocity and particle stresses in a periodic box as input to the learning pipeline. the second step takes the morphology and positions orientations of particles to predict pairwise interaction forces between them with a E(2)-equivariant graph neural network that necessarily respect flat symmetries. Then, a physics-informed neural network further updates these local estimates by summing over them with a stress data using Fourier feature mappings and residual blocks that is additionally regularized with a topological term (introduced by persistent homology) to penalize unrealistically tangled or spurious connections. In concert, these stages deliver an holistic highly-data driven full force network prediction empathizing on the physical underpinnings together with emerging multi-scale structure typical for active matter.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking GNN Expressive Power from a Distributed Computational Model Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01308v4)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of graph neural networks (GNNs) has motivated theoretical studies on their expressive power, often through alignments with the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) tests. However, such analyses typically focus on the ability of GNNs to distinguish between graph structures, rather than to compute or approximate specific function classes. The latter is more commonly studied in machine learning theory, including results such as the Turing completeness of recurrent networks and the universal approximation property of feedforward networks. We argue that using well-defined computational models, such as a modified CONGEST model with clearly specified preprocessing and postprocessing, offers a more sound framework for analyzing GNN expressiveness. Within this framework, we show that allowing unrestricted preprocessing or incorporating externally computed features, while claiming that these precomputations enhance the expressiveness, can sometimes lead to problems. We also show that the lower bound on a GNN's capacity (depth multiplied by width) to simulate one iteration of the WL test actually grows nearly linearly with graph size, indicating that the WL test is not locally computable and is misaligned with message-passing GNNs. Despite these negative results, we also present positive results that characterize the effects of virtual nodes and edges from a computational model perspective. Finally, we highlight several open problems regarding GNN expressiveness for further exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Resource Allocation in Interference-limited Multi-Channel Wireless Networks with QoS Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06395v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meeting minimum data rate constraints is a significant challenge in wireless communication systems, particularly as network complexity grows. Traditional deep learning approaches often address these constraints by incorporating penalty terms into the loss function and tuning hyperparameters empirically. However, this heuristic treatment offers no theoretical convergence guarantees and frequently fails to satisfy QoS requirements in practical scenarios. Building upon the structure of the WMMSE algorithm, we first extend it to a multi-channel setting with QoS constraints, resulting in the enhanced WMMSE (eWMMSE) algorithm, which is provably convergent to a locally optimal solution when the problem is feasible. To further reduce computational complexity and improve scalability, we develop a GNN-based algorithm, JCPGNN-M, capable of supporting simultaneous multi-channel allocation per user. To overcome the limitations of traditional deep learning methods, we propose a principled framework that integrates GNN with a Lagrangian-based primal-dual optimization method. By training the GNN within the Lagrangian framework, we ensure satisfaction of QoS constraints and convergence to a stationary point. Extensive simulations demonstrate that JCPGNN-M matches the performance of eWMMSE while offering significant gains in inference speed, generalization to larger networks, and robustness under imperfect channel state information. This work presents a scalable and theoretically grounded solution for constrained resource allocation in future wireless networks.</p></details> |  |

Functional testing detects SDE-related faults but is expensive to simulate. We present a unified spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) for fast, accurate prediction of long-cycle fault impact probabilities (FIPs) in large sequential circuits, supporting quantitative risk assessment. Gate-level netlists are modeled as spatio-temporal graphs to capture topology and signal timing; dedicated spatial and temporal encoders predict multi-cycle FIPs efficiently. On ISCAS-89 benchmarks, the method reduces simulation time by more than 10x while maintaining high accuracy (mean absolute error 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions). The framework accepts features from testability metrics or fault simulation, allowing efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

We present RecMind, an LLM-enhanced graph recommender that treats the language model as a preference prior rather than a monolithic ranker. A frozen LLM equipped with lightweight adapters produces text-conditioned user/item embeddings from titles, attributes, and reviews; a LightGCN backbone learns collaborative embeddings from the user-item graph. We align the two views with a symmetric contrastive objective and fuse them via intra-layer gating, allowing language to dominate in cold/long-tail regimes and graph structure to stabilize rankings elsewhere. On Yelp and Amazon-Electronics, RecMind attains the best results on all eight reported metrics, with relative improvements up to +4.53\% (Recall@40) and +4.01\% (NDCG@40) over strong baselines. Ablations confirm both the necessity of cross-view alignment and the advantage of gating over late fusion and LLM-only variants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Efficient Time-Dependent PDE Surrogates: Graph Neural Simulators vs Neural Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06154v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operators (NOs) approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces but require large datasets and struggle with scarce training data. Many NO formulations don't explicitly encode causal, local-in-time structure of physical evolution. While autoregressive models preserve causality by predicting next time-steps, they suffer from rapid error accumulation. We employ Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) - a message-passing graph neural network framework - with explicit numerical time-stepping schemes to construct accurate forward models that learn PDE solutions by modeling instantaneous time derivatives. We evaluate our framework on three canonical PDE systems: (1) 2D Burgers' scalar equation, (2) 2D coupled Burgers' vector equation, and (3) 2D Allen-Cahn equation. Rigorous evaluations demonstrate GNS significantly improves data efficiency, achieving higher generalization accuracy with substantially fewer training trajectories compared to neural operator baselines like DeepONet and FNO. GNS consistently achieves under 1% relative L2 errors with only 30 training samples out of 1000 (3% of available data) across all three PDE systems. It substantially reduces error accumulation over extended temporal horizons: averaged across all cases, GNS reduces autoregressive error by 82.48% relative to FNO AR and 99.86% relative to DON AR. We introduce a PCA+KMeans trajectory selection strategy enhancing low-data performance. Results indicate combining graph-based local inductive biases with conventional time integrators yields accurate, physically consistent, and scalable surrogate models for time-dependent PDEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages including references.

Recent developments in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data, particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy, improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.</p></details> |  |

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates context scarcity by retrieving relevant code snippets, current approaches face significant limitations. They overly rely on textual similarity for retrieval, neglecting structural relationships such as call chains and inheritance hierarchies, and lose critical structural information by naively concatenating retrieved snippets into text sequences for LLM input. To address these shortcomings, GRACE constructs a multi-level, multi-semantic code graph that unifies file structures, abstract syntax trees, function call graphs, class hierarchies, and data flow graphs to capture both static and dynamic code semantics. For retrieval, GRACE employs a Hybrid Graph Retriever that integrates graph neural network-based structural similarity with textual retrieval, refined by a graph attention network-based re-ranker to prioritize topologically relevant subgraphs. To enhance context, GRACE introduces a structural fusion mechanism that merges retrieved subgraphs with the local code context and preserves essential dependencies like function calls and inheritance. Extensive experiments on public repository-level benchmarks demonstrate that GRACE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all metrics. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the backbone LLM, GRACE surpasses the strongest graph-based RAG baselines by 8.19% EM and 7.51% ES points on every dataset.

However, the precise and efficient decoding of MI remains challenging due to their non-stationary nature and low signal-to-noise ratio. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end deep learning framework of Discriminative Residual Dense Convolutional Autoencoder with Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (DRDCAE-STGNN) to enhance the MI feature learning and classification. Specifically, the DRDCAE module leverages residual-dense connections to learn discriminative latent representations through joint reconstruction and classifica-tion, while the STGNN module captures dynamic spatial dependencies via a learnable graph adjacency matrix and models temporal dynamics using bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM). Extensive evaluations on BCI Competition IV 2a, 2b, and PhysioNet datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 95.42%, 97.51%, and 90.15%, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component, and interpreta-bility analysis reveals neurophysiologically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, despite its complexity, the model maintains a feasible parameter count and an inference time of 0.32 ms per sample. These results indicate that our method offers a robust, accurate, and interpretable solution for MI-EEG decoding, with strong generalizability across subjects and tasks and meeting the requirements for potential real-time BCI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submit to IEEE Journal</p></details> |

With upgrades scheduled for the detectors of colliding-beam experiments around the world, and specifically at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, more collisions and more complex interactions are expected. This directly implies an increase in data produced and consequently in the computational resources needed to process them. At CERN, the amount of data produced is gargantuan. This is why the data have to be heavily filtered and selected in real time before being permanently stored. This data can then be used to perform physics analyses, in order to expand our current understanding of the universe and improve the Standard Model of physics. This real-time filtering, known as triggering, involves complex processing happening often at frequencies as high as 40 MHz. This thesis contributes to understanding how machine learning models can be efficiently deployed in such environments, in order to maximize throughput and minimize energy consumption. Inevitably, modern hardware designed for such tasks and contemporary algorithms are needed in order to meet the challenges posed by the stringent, high-frequency data rates. In this work, I present our graph neural network-based pipeline, developed for charged particle track reconstruction at the LHCb experiment at CERN. The pipeline was implemented end-to-end inside LHCb's first-level trigger, entirely on GPUs. Its performance was compared against the classical tracking algorithms currently in production at LHCb. The pipeline was also accelerated on the FPGA architecture, and its performance in terms of power consumption and processing speed was compared against the GPU implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD t...</summary><p>PhD thesis, Chapters 8 and 9 include results from work performed in collaboration with Anthony Correia</p></details> |
| **[Pruning Spurious Subgraphs for Graph Out-of-Distribution Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05957v4)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often encounter significant performance degradation under distribution shifts between training and test data, hindering their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent studies have proposed various methods to address the out-of-distribution generalization challenge, with many methods in the graph domain focusing on directly identifying an invariant subgraph that is predictive of the target label. However, we argue that identifying the edges from the invariant subgraph directly is challenging and error-prone, especially when some spurious edges exhibit strong correlations with the targets. In this paper, we propose PrunE, the first pruning-based graph OOD method that eliminates spurious edges to improve OOD generalizability. By pruning spurious edges, PrunE retains the invariant subgraph more comprehensively, which is critical for OOD generalization. Specifically, PrunE employs two regularization terms to prune spurious edges: 1) graph size constraint to exclude uninformative spurious edges, and 2) $\epsilon$-probability alignment to further suppress the occurrence of spurious edges. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that PrunE achieves superior OOD performance and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods significantly.

To mitigate these challenges, we propose a distributed link sparsification scheme employing graph neural networks (GNNs) to reduce scheduling overhead for delay-tolerant traffic while maintaining network capacity. A GNN module is trained to adjust contention thresholds for individual links based on traffic statistics and network topology, enabling links to withdraw from scheduling contention when they are unlikely to succeed. Our approach is facilitated by a novel offline constrained {unsupervised} learning algorithm capable of balancing two competing objectives: minimizing scheduling overhead while ensuring that total utility meets the required level. In simulated wireless multi-hop networks with up to 500 links, our link sparsification technique effectively alleviates network congestion and reduces radio footprints across four distinct distributed link scheduling protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 18 figures, accepted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications.

Among existing methods, the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) has gained popularity due to its strong convergence guarantees and suitability for decentralized computation. However, ADMM often suffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In this work, we show that distributed ADMM iterations can be naturally represented within the message-passing framework of graph neural networks (GNNs). Building on this connection, we propose to learn adaptive step sizes and communication weights by a graph neural network that predicts the hyperparameters based on the iterates. By unrolling ADMM for a fixed number of iterations, we train the network parameters end-to-end to minimize the final iterates error for a given problem class, while preserving the algorithm's convergence properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our learned variant consistently improves convergence speed and solution quality compared to standard ADMM.

MatterVial expands the feature space by integrating latent representations from a diverse suite of pretrained graph neural network (GNN) models including: structure-based (MEGNet), composition-based (ROOST), and equivariant (ORB) graph networks, with computationally efficient, GNN-approximated descriptors and novel features from symbolic regression. Our approach combines the chemical transparency of traditional feature-based models with the predictive power of deep learning architectures. When augmenting the feature-based model MODNet on Matbench tasks, this method yields significant error reductions and elevates its performance to be competitive with, and in several cases superior to, state-of-the-art end-to-end GNNs, with accuracy increases exceeding 40% for multiple tasks. An integrated interpretability module, employing surrogate models and symbolic regression, decodes the latent GNN-derived descriptors into explicit, physically meaningful formulas. This unified framework advances materials informatics by providing a high-performance, transparent tool that aligns with the principles of explainable AI, paving the way for more targeted and autonomous materials discovery.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based approaches mitigate the computational loads, yet the communication overhead remains a challenge. This paper presents RapidGNN, a distributed GNN training framework with deterministic sampling-based scheduling to enable efficient cache construction and prefetching of remote features. Evaluation on benchmark graph datasets demonstrates RapidGNN's effectiveness across different scales and topologies. RapidGNN improves end-to-end training throughput by 2.46x to 3.00x on average over baseline methods across the benchmark datasets, while cutting remote feature fetches by over 9.70x to 15.39x. RapidGNN further demonstrates near-linear scalability with an increasing number of computing units efficiently. Furthermore, it achieves increased energy efficiency over the baseline methods for both CPU and GPU by 44% and 32%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2505.10806</p></details> |

Although individual tasks may be simple in isolation, automated joint task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning under spatio-temporal constraints remain computationally intractable for classical methods at real-world scales. Existing multi-arm systems deployed in the industry rely on human intuition and experience to design feasible trajectories manually in a labor-intensive process. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to achieve automated task and motion planning, tested in an obstacle-rich environment with eight robots performing 40 reaching tasks in a shared workspace, where any robot can perform any task in any order. Our approach builds on a graph neural network (GNN) policy trained via RL on procedurally-generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot configurations, and task distributions. It employs a graph representation of scenes and a graph policy neural network trained through reinforcement learning to generate trajectories of multiple robots, jointly solving the sub-problems of task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. Trained on large randomly generated task sets in simulation, our policy generalizes zero-shot to unseen settings with varying robot placements, obstacle geometries, and task poses. We further demonstrate that the high-speed capability of our solution enables its use in workcell layout optimization, improving solution times. The speed and scalability of our planner also open the door to new capabilities such as fault-tolerant planning and online perception-based re-planning, where rapid adaptation to dynamic task sets is required.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Science Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Matrix Factorization Based Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05115v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, methods that combine contrastive learning with graph neural networks have emerged to address the challenges of recommendation systems, demonstrating powerful performance and playing a significant role in this domain. Contrastive learning primarily tackles the issue of data sparsity by employing data augmentation strategies, effectively alleviating this problem and showing promising results. Although existing research has achieved favorable outcomes, most current graph contrastive learning methods are based on two types of data augmentation strategies: the first involves perturbing the graph structure, such as by randomly adding or removing edges; and the second applies clustering techniques. We believe that the interactive information obtained through these two strategies does not fully capture the user-item interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel method called HMFGCL (Hybrid Matrix Factorization Based Graph Contrastive Learning), which integrates two distinct matrix factorization techniques-low-rank matrix factorization (MF) and singular value decomposition (SVD)-to complementarily acquire global collaborative information, thereby constructing enhanced views. Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing baselines, particularly on small-scale datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Unlearning: Efficient Node Removal in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04785v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With increasing concerns about privacy attacks and potential sensitive information leakage, researchers have actively explored methods to efficiently remove sensitive training data and reduce privacy risks in graph neural network (GNN) models. Node unlearning has emerged as a promising technique for protecting the privacy of sensitive nodes by efficiently removing specific training node information from GNN models. However, existing node unlearning methods either impose restrictions on the GNN structure or do not effectively utilize the graph topology for node unlearning. Some methods even compromise the graph's topology, making it challenging to achieve a satisfactory performance-complexity trade-off. To address these issues and achieve efficient unlearning for training node removal in GNNs, we propose three novel node unlearning methods: Class-based Label Replacement, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability, and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering. Among these methods, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering effectively leverage the topological features of the graph, resulting in more effective node unlearning. To validate the superiority of our proposed methods in node unlearning, we conducted experiments on three benchmark datasets. The evaluation criteria included model utility, unlearning utility, and unlearning efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed methods and illustrate their superiority compared to state-of-the-art node unlearning methods. Overall, the proposed methods efficiently remove sensitive training nodes and protect the privacy information of sensitive nodes in GNNs. The findings contribute to enhancing the privacy and security of GNN models and provide valuable insights into the field of node unlearning.</p></details> |  |

The images are traditionally represented as a grid graph with each node representing a pixel and edges connecting neighboring pixels (vertically and horizontally). The graph signal is the values (intensities) of each pixel in the image. The graphs are commonly used as input to graph neural networks (e.g., Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (Graph CNNs) [1, 2], Graph Attention Networks (GAT) [3], GatedGCN [4]) to classify the images. In this work, we improve the accuracy of downstream graph neural network tasks by finding alternative graphs to the grid graph and superpixel methods to represent the dataset images, following the approach in [5, 6]. We find row correlation, column correlation, and product graphs for each image in MNIST and Fashion-MNIST using correlations between the pixel values building on the method in [5, 6]. Experiments show that using these different graph representations and features as input into downstream GNN models improves the accuracy over using the traditional grid graph and superpixel methods in the literature.</p></details> |  |

While classical approaches such as Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) remain widely used, they often fail to capture the spatial dependencies inherent in energy networks. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework to incorporate this structure by directly leveraging graph topologies. In this work, we evaluate a broad set of GNN architectures -- including GCN, GraphSAGE, ChebConv, TAG, APPNP, TransformerConv, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT and GATv2) -- on two real-world electricity consumption datasets from France and the UK. Our results show that simpler models such as GCN, SAGE, or APPNP often outperform more complex alternatives in low-data regimes, while GAT ranks among the strongest architectures in our benchmarks, combining high accuracy with valuable interpretability. We perform a temporal analysis of attention weights, revealing evolving patterns of regional interaction linked to seasonal and meteorological variability. These results highlight that, although attention is not universally superior, it provides valuable explanatory power when spatial dependencies are prominent. Additionally, we demonstrate that ensemble-based expert aggregation strategies, particularly bottom-up combinations, significantly improve robustness and yield state-of-the-art performance across both datasets. These findings highlight the dual promise of GNNs for accurate and interpretable forecasting, and suggest that architectural simplicity coupled with ensemble methods can provide a practical path forward for transparent energy analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, ECML PKDD 2025 Workshop paper</p></details> |

We introduce Topotein, a comprehensive framework that applies topological deep learning to PRL through the novel Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) and Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet). Our PCC represents proteins at multiple hierarchical levels -- from residues to secondary structures to complete proteins -- while preserving geometric information at each level. TCPNet employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchical structures, enabling more effective capture of multi-scale structural patterns. Through extensive experiments on four PRL tasks, TCPNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks. Our approach demonstrates particular strength in tasks such as fold classification which require understanding of secondary structure arrangements, validating the importance of hierarchical topological features for protein analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, the process is often subjective, with variability between experts. As a result, numerous deep learning-based automatic classification methods have emerged, most of which focus on respiratory sound classification. In contrast, research on respiratory sound event detection remains limited. Existing sound event detection methods typically rely on frame-level predictions followed by post-processing to generate event-level outputs, making interval boundaries challenging to learn directly. Furthermore, many approaches can only handle fixed-length audio, limiting their applicability to variable-length respiratory sounds. Additionally, the impact of respiratory sound location information on detection performance has not been extensively explored. To address these issues, we propose a graph neural network-based framework with anchor intervals, capable of handling variable-length audio and providing more precise temporal localization for abnormal respiratory sound events. Our method improves both the flexibility and applicability of respiratory sound detection. Experiments on the SPRSound 2024 and HF Lung V1 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and incorporating respiratory position information enhances the discrimination between abnormal sounds.

Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems. However, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in static free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving primitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically moving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed from the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body interactions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph nodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations with the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. This approach enables the network to model complex interactions between liquid particles and intricate surface geometries. Our model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic settings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments. Despite being trained on a single-object manipulation task of pouring, our model generalizes effectively to environments with unseen objects and novel manipulation tasks such as stirring and scooping. Finally, we show that the learned dynamics can be leveraged to solve control and manipulation tasks using gradient-based optimization methods.</p></details> |  |

When treating sepsis, it is challenging to determine the correct amount of intravenous fluids and vasopressors for a given patient. While automated reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have been used to support these decisions with promising results, previous studies have relied on relational data. Given the complexity of modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more natural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the well-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time. Subsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and GATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of decoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are trained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that predict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy learning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation confirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the complexity of representation learning in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>18th ...</summary><p>18th European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning (EWRL 2025)</p></details> |

Despite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods fail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency, making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary details. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph unmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a transformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work, T-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph structure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods.

Through an extensive analysis of relevant studies, it is found that there is a lack of research work concerning algorithm selection oriented toward the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP). In this work, we propose a learning-based framework that integrates both traditional machine learning and graph neural networks to address this gap. We construct a labeled dataset by running four exact MCP algorithms on a diverse collection of graph instances, accompanied by structural and global statistical features extracted from each graph. We first evaluate four conventional classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), across multiple dataset variants. Experimental results show that RF consistently shows strong performance across metrics and dataset variants, making it a reliable baseline. In addition, feature importance analysis indicates that connectivity and topological structure are strong predictors of algorithm performance. Building on these findings, we develop a dual-channel model named GAT-MLP, which combines a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for local structural encoding with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for global feature modeling. The GAT-MLP model shows strong and consistent performance across all metrics. Our results highlight the effectiveness of dual-channel architectures and the promise of graph neural networks in combinatorial algorithm selection.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

However, as of yet, the analysis of social networks using the time series of people's mobile connectivity data has not been extensively investigated. In the present study, we investigate four snapshot - based temporal GNNs in predicting the phone call and SMS activity between users of a mobile communication network. In addition, we develop a simple non - GNN baseline model using recently proposed EdgeBank method. Our analysis shows that the ROLAND temporal GNN outperforms the baseline model in most cases, whereas the other three GNNs perform on average worse than the baseline. The results show that GNN based approaches hold promise in the analysis of temporal social networks through mobile connectivity data. However, due to the relatively small performance margin between ROLAND and the baseline model, further research is required on specialized GNN architectures for temporal social network analysis.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Can Large Language Models Act as Ensembler for Multi-GNNs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16822v5)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning from graph-structured data. However, GNNs lack the inherent semantic understanding capability of rich textual node attributes, limiting their effectiveness in applications. On the other hand, we empirically observe that for existing GNN models, no one can consistently outperforms others across diverse datasets. In this paper, we study whether LLMs can act as an ensembler for multi-GNNs and propose the LensGNN model. The model first aligns multiple GNNs, mapping the representations of different GNNs into the same space. Then, through LoRA fine-tuning, it aligns the space between the GNN and the LLM, injecting graph tokens and textual information into LLMs. This allows LensGNN to ensemble multiple GNNs and take advantage of the strengths of LLM, leading to a deeper understanding of both textual semantic information and graph structural information. The experimental results show that LensGNN outperforms existing models. This research advances text-attributed graph ensemble learning by providing a robust and superior solution for integrating semantic and structural information.

However, the reliability of XAI is challenged by the Rashomon effect, where multiple, equally accurate models can offer divergent explanations for the same prediction. This paper provides the first empirical quantification of this effect for the task of action prediction in real-world driving scenes. Using Qualitative Explainable Graphs (QXGs) as a symbolic scene representation, we train Rashomon sets of two distinct model classes: interpretable, pair-based gradient boosting models and complex, graph-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Using feature attribution methods, we measure the agreement of explanations both within and between these classes. Our results reveal significant explanation disagreement. Our findings suggest that explanation ambiguity is an inherent property of the problem, not just a modeling artifact.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 Fall Symposium: AI Trustworthiness and Risk Assessment for Challenged Contexts (ATRACC)</p></details> |
| **[Memorization in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19352v3)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to memorize their training data, yet similar analyses for graph neural networks (GNNs) remain largely under-explored. We introduce NCMemo (Node Classification Memorization), the first framework to quantify label memorization in semi-supervised node classification. We first establish an inverse relationship between memorization and graph homophily, i.e., the property that connected nodes share similar labels/features. We find that lower homophily significantly increases memorization, indicating that GNNs rely on memorization to learn less homophilic graphs. Secondly, we analyze GNN training dynamics. We find that the increased memorization in low homophily graphs is tightly coupled to the GNNs' implicit bias on using graph structure during learning. In low homophily regimes, this structure is less informative, hence inducing memorization of the node labels to minimize training loss. Finally, we show that nodes with higher label inconsistency in their feature-space neighborhood are significantly more prone to memorization. Building on our insights into the link between graph homophily and memorization, we investigate graph rewiring as a means to mitigate memorization. Our results demonstrate that this approach effectively reduces memorization without compromising model performance. Moreover, we show that it lowers the privacy risk for previously memorized data points in practice. Thus, our work not only advances understanding of GNN learning but also supports more privacy-preserving GNN deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version3, updated affiliation</p></details> |

We propose a cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving blood-flow fields using a graph neural network on the AnXplore dataset. Our experiments show that the inclusion of these features yields strong gains in accuracy, F1-score and segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines, and reduces simulation error by 15\%. These results illustrate the broader potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative models to specialized medical tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical Test for Saliency Maps of Graph Neural Networks via Selective Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16893v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence for their ability to process graph-structured data across various domains. However, interpreting GNN decisions remains a significant challenge, leading to the adoption of saliency maps for identifying salient subgraphs composed of influential nodes and edges. Despite their utility, the reliability of GNN saliency maps has been questioned, particularly in terms of their robustness to input noise. In this study, we propose a statistical testing framework to rigorously evaluate the significance of saliency maps. Our main contribution lies in addressing the inflation of the Type I error rate caused by double-dipping of data, leveraging the framework of Selective Inference. Our method provides statistically valid $p$-values while controlling the Type I error rate, ensuring that identified salient subgraphs contain meaningful information rather than random artifacts. The method is applicable to a variety of saliency methods with piecewise linearity (e.g., Class Activation Mapping). We validate our method on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its capability in assessing the reliability of GNN interpretations.</p></details> |  |

Our method combines structural learning from graph neural networks (GNNs) with a learned distributed update mechanism that, given an edge addition or deletion event, modifies nodes' internal memories and infers their MaxIS membership in a single, parallel step. We parameterize our model by the update mechanism's radius and investigate the resulting performance-runtime tradeoffs for various dynamic graph topologies. We evaluate our model against a mixed integer programming solver and the state-of-the-art learning-based methods for MaxIS on static graphs (ICML 2020; NeurIPS 2020, 2023). Across synthetic and empirical dynamic graphs of 50-1,000 nodes, our model achieves competitive approximation ratios with excellent scalability; on large graphs, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art learning methods in solution quality, runtime, and memory usage. When generalizing to graphs of 10,000 nodes (100x larger than the ones used for training), our model produces MaxIS solutions 1.05-1.18x larger than any other learning method, even while maintaining competitive runtimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, 3 algorithms</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce RankGraph, a scalable graph learning framework designed to serve as a core component in recommendation foundation models (FMs). By constructing and leveraging graphs composed of heterogeneous nodes and edges across multiple products, RankGraph enables the integration of complex relationships between users, posts, ads, and other entities. Our framework employs a GPU-accelerated Graph Neural Network and contrastive learning, allowing for dynamic extraction of subgraphs such as item-item and user-user graphs to support similarity-based retrieval and real-time clustering. Furthermore, RankGraph integrates graph-based pretrained representations as contextual tokens into FM sequence models, enriching them with structured relational knowledge. RankGraph has demonstrated improvements in click (+0.92%) and conversion rates (+2.82%) in online A/B tests, showcasing its effectiveness in cross-domain recommendation scenarios.</p></details> | RecSys 2025 |

However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc descriptor-based residual-based learning (PDRL). PDRL models the discrepancy between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of PDRL and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their effectiveness and limitations.</p></details> |  |

While algorithms have been proposed to improve the accuracy of training graph neural networks, such as node classification on federated graphs, the system performance is often overlooked, despite it is crucial for real-world deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce FedGraph, a research library designed for practical distributed training and comprehensive benchmarking of FGL algorithms. FedGraph supports a range of state-of-the-art graph learning methods and includes a monitoring class that evaluates system performance, with a particular focus on communication and computation costs during training. Unlike existing federated learning platforms, FedGraph natively integrates homomorphic encryption to enhance privacy preservation and supports scalable deployment across multiple physical machines with system-level performance evaluation to guide the system design of future algorithms. To enhance efficiency and privacy, we propose a low-rank communication scheme for algorithms like FedGCN that require pre-training communication, accelerating both the pre-training and training phases. Extensive experiments benchmark FGL algorithms on three major graph learning tasks and demonstrate FedGraph as the first efficient FGL framework to support encrypted low-rank communication and scale to graphs with 100 million nodes.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/FedGraph/fedgraph</p></details> |
| **[Power Grid Control with Graph-Based Distributed Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02861v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The necessary integration of renewable energy sources, combined with the expanding scale of power networks, presents significant challenges in controlling modern power grids. Traditional control systems, which are human and optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving context, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control strategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning framework for real-time, scalable grid management. The proposed architecture consists of a network of distributed low-level agents acting on individual power lines and coordinated by a high-level manager agent. A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information within the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and enhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and potential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized approaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global observations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level agent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment constructed through the GNN. Experiments on the Grid2Op simulation environment show the effectiveness of the approach, which consistently outperforms the standard baseline commonly adopted in the field. Additionally, the proposed model proves to be much more computationally efficient than the simulation-based Expert method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Laplacian Eigenvectors: a Pre-training Method for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02803v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by inductively learning Laplacian eigenvectors. Traditional Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) often struggle to capture global and regional graph structure due to over-smoothing risk as network depth increases. Because the low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix encode global information, pre-training GNNs to predict these eigenvectors encourages the network to naturally learn large-scale structural patterns over each graph. Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform baseline models on a variety of graph structure-based tasks. While most existing pre-training methods focus on domain-specific tasks like node or edge feature reconstruction, our self-supervised pre-training framework is structure-based and highly flexible. Eigenvector-learning can be applied to all graph-based datasets, and can be used with synthetic features when task-specific data is sparse.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Directed Hypergraph Neural Network over abstract syntax tree (AST) for Code Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04228v4)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code classification is a difficult issue in program understanding and automatic coding. Due to the elusive syntax and complicated semantics in programs, most existing studies use techniques based on abstract syntax tree (AST) and graph neural networks (GNN) to create code representations for code classification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information of the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect the high-order data correlations that already exist between nodes of the same field or called attribute in the AST, which may result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while a general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous and undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural information such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes and parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) to represent AST and a heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) to process the graph for code classification. Our method improves code understanding and can represent high-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess our heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of Python and Java programs. Our method outperforms previous AST-based and GNN-based methods, which demonstrates the capability of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 35th International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE 2023) as a regular paper</p></details> |
| **[HydroGAT: Distributed Heterogeneous Graph Attention Transformer for Spatiotemporal Flood Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02481v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate flood forecasting remains a challenge for water-resource management, as it demands modeling of local, time-varying runoff drivers (e.g., rainfall-induced peaks, baseflow trends) and complex spatial interactions across a river network. Traditional data-driven approaches, such as convolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological information about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate information exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning hydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction models collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training explodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing methods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying GNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences, thus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for accurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every land and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow directions and inter-catchment relationships. We propose HydroGAT, a spatiotemporal network that adaptively learns local temporal importance and the most influential upstream locations. Evaluated in two Midwestern US basins and across five baseline architectures, our model achieves higher NSE (up to 0.97), improved KGE (up to 0.96), and low bias (PBIAS within $\pm$5%) in hourly discharge prediction, while offering interpretable attention maps that reveal sparse, structured intercatchment influences. To support high-resolution basin-scale training, we develop a distributed data-parallel pipeline that scales efficiently up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer, demonstrating up to 15x speedup across machines.

Among operational loads, traffic load plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation. To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.</p></details> |  |

Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas \textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving \textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.</p></details> |  |

Process-based models provide physical realism but can suffer from structural rigidity, high computational costs, and complex calibration, while machine learning (ML) methods are efficient and flexible yet often lack interpretability and transferability. We propose a unified three-phase framework that integrates process-based models with ML and progressively embeds them into artificial intelligence (AI) through knowledge distillation. Phase I, behavioral distillation, enhances process models via surrogate learning and model simplification to capture key dynamics at lower computational cost. Phase II, structural distillation, reformulates process equations as modular components within a graph neural network (GNN), enabling multiscale representation and seamless integration with ML models. Phase III, cognitive distillation, embeds expert reasoning and adaptive decision-making into intelligent modeling agents using the Eyes-Brain-Hands-Mouth architecture. Demonstrations for the Samish watershed highlight the framework's applicability to ecohydrological modeling, showing that it can reproduce process-based model outputs, improve predictive accuracy, and support scenario-based decision-making. The framework offers a scalable and transferable pathway toward next-generation intelligent ecohydrological modeling systems, with the potential extension to other process-based domains.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

Previous research has looked into this problem from the perspective of i.i.d. data. Here, we develop a framework, GraCE-VAE, for non-i.i.d. settings, in which structured context in the form of network data is available. GraCE-VAE integrates discrepancy-based variational autoencoders with graph neural networks to jointly recover the true latent causal graph and intervention effects. We show that the theoretical results of identifiability from i.i.d. data hold in our setup. We also empirically evaluate GraCE-VAE against state-of-the-art baselines on three genetic perturbation datasets to demonstrate the impact of leveraging structured context for causal disentanglement.</p></details> |  |

Eye Tracking-Based Modeling of Situational Awareness in Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05025v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g., bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved 83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.</p></details> |  |

However, the high dimensionality and technical noise inherent in scRNA-seq data pose significant analytical challenges. While current embedding methods focus primarily on gene expression levels, they often overlook crucial gene-gene interactions that govern cellular identity and function. To address this limitation, we present a novel embedding approach that integrates both gene expression profiles and data-driven gene-gene interactions. Our method first constructs a Cell-Leaf Graph (CLG) using random forest models to capture regulatory relationships between genes, while simultaneously building a K-Nearest Neighbor Graph (KNNG) to represent expression similarities between cells. These graphs are then combined into an Enriched Cell-Leaf Graph (ECLG), which serves as input for a graph neural network to compute cell embeddings. By incorporating both expression levels and gene-gene interactions, our approach provides a more comprehensive representation of cellular states. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets demonstrates that our method enhances the detection of rare cell populations and improves downstream analyses such as visualization, clustering, and trajectory inference. This integrated approach represents a significant advance in single-cell data analysis, offering a more complete framework for understanding cellular diversity and dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 9 figures, article</p></details> |

Automated Essay Scoring (AES) offers a promising alternative, but current approaches face limitations. Recent studies have incorporated Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into AES using static word embeddings that fail to capture contextual meaning, especially for polysemous words. Additionally, many methods rely on holistic scoring, overlooking specific writing aspects such as grammar, vocabulary, and cohesion. To address these challenges, this study proposes TransGAT, a novel approach that integrates fine-tuned Transformer models with GNNs for analytic scoring. TransGAT combines the contextual understanding of Transformers with the relational modeling strength of Graph Attention Networks (GAT). It performs two-stream predictions by pairing each fine-tuned Transformer (BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTaV3) with a separate GAT. In each pair, the first stream generates essay-level predictions, while the second applies GAT to Transformer token embeddings, with edges constructed from syntactic dependencies. The model then fuses predictions from both streams to produce the final analytic score. Experiments on the ELLIPSE dataset show that TransGAT outperforms baseline models, achieving an average Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.854 across all analytic scoring dimensions. These findings highlight the potential of TransGAT to advance AES systems.</p></details> |  |

We ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications, as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

While significant progress has been made in detecting falls, the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states: stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state, offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced assistance systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE RO-MAN 2025</p></details> |

A key characteristic of GNNs is their use of a fixed number of message-passing steps for all nodes in the graph, regardless of each node's diverse computational needs and characteristics. Through empirical real-world data analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal number of message-passing layers varies for nodes with different characteristics. This finding is further supported by experiments conducted on synthetic datasets. To address this, we propose Adaptive Depth Message Passing GNN (ADMP-GNN), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts the number of message passing layers for each node, resulting in improved performance. This approach applies to any model that follows the message passing scheme. We evaluate ADMP-GNN on the node classification task and observe performance improvements over baseline GNN models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Exploring Language Models for Explainable Link Forecasting on Temporal Graphs via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00975v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning, requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones. Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs. ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superposition in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00928v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpreting graph neural networks (GNNs) is difficult because message passing mixes signals and internal channels rarely align with human concepts. We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features, directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics. Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Unified Textual Graph Framework for Spectral Reasoning via Physical and Chemical Information Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17761v2)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the limitations of current spectral analysis methods-such as reliance on single-modality data, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability-we propose a novel multi-modal spectral analysis framework that integrates prior knowledge graphs with Large Language Models. Our method explicitly bridges physical spectral measurements and chemical structural semantics by representing them in a unified Textual Graph format, enabling flexible, interpretable, and generalizable spectral understanding. Raw spectra are first transformed into TAGs, where nodes and edges are enriched with textual attributes describing both spectral properties and chemical context. These are then merged with relevant prior knowledge-including functional groups and molecular graphs-to form a Task Graph that incorporates "Prompt Nodes" supporting LLM-based contextual reasoning. A Graph Neural Network further processes this structure to complete downstream tasks. This unified design enables seamless multi-modal integration and automated feature decoding with minimal manual annotation. Our framework achieves consistently high performance across multiple spectral analysis tasks, including node-level, edge-level, and graph-level classification. It demonstrates robust generalization in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, highlighting its effectiveness in learning from limited data and supporting in-context reasoning. This work establishes a scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM-driven spectral analysis, unifying physical and chemical modalities for scientific applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ne...</summary><p>We need to further modify and supplement the experiment</p></details> |
| **[UQGNN: Uncertainty Quantification of Graph Neural Networks for Multivariate Spatiotemporal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08551v2)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic, i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty, leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes), thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and (ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5% improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, SIGSPATIAL 2025</p></details> |
| **[FIT-GNN: Faster Inference Time for GNNs that 'FIT' in Memory Using Coarsening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15001v3)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scalability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) remains a significant challenge. To tackle this, methods like coarsening, condensation, and computation trees are used to train on a smaller graph, resulting in faster computation. Nonetheless, prior research has not adequately addressed the computational costs during the inference phase. This paper presents a novel approach to improve the scalability of GNNs by reducing computational burden during the inference phase using graph coarsening. We demonstrate two different methods -- Extra Nodes and Cluster Nodes. Our study extends the application of graph coarsening for graph-level tasks, including graph classification and graph regression. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of our approach. Our results show that the proposed method achieves orders of magnitude improvements in single-node inference time compared to traditional approaches. Furthermore, it significantly reduces memory consumption for node and graph classification and regression tasks, enabling efficient training and inference on low-resource devices where conventional methods are impractical. Notably, these computational advantages are achieved while maintaining competitive performance relative to baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow Matters: Directional and Expressive GNNs for Heterophilic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00772v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often belong to different classes, conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle due to their reliance on local homophilous neighborhoods. Prior studies suggest that modeling edge directionality in such graphs can increase effective homophily and improve classification performance. Simultaneously, recent work on polynomially expressive GNNs shows promise in capturing higher-order interactions among features. In this work, we study the combined effect of edge directionality and expressive message passing on node classification in heterophilic graphs. Specifically, we propose two architectures: (1) a polynomially expressive GAT baseline (Poly), and (2) a direction-aware variant (Dir-Poly) that separately aggregates incoming and outgoing edges. Both models are designed to learn permutation-equivariant high-degree polynomials over input features, while remaining scalable with no added time complexity. Experiments on five benchmark heterophilic datasets show that our Poly model consistently outperforms existing baselines, and that Dir-Poly offers additional gains on graphs with inherent directionality (e.g., Roman Empire), achieving state-of-the-art results. Interestingly, on undirected graphs, introducing artificial directionality does not always help, suggesting that the benefit of directional message passing is context-dependent. Our findings highlight the complementary roles of edge direction and expressive feature modeling in heterophilic graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Anchors to Answers: A Novel Node Tokenizer for Integrating Graph Structure into Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10743v2)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling large language models (LLMs) to effectively process and reason with graph-structured data remains a significant challenge despite their remarkable success in natural language tasks. Current approaches either convert graph structures into verbose textual descriptions, consuming substantial computational resources, or employ complex graph neural networks as tokenizers, which introduce significant training overhead. To bridge this gap, we present NT-LLM, a novel framework with an anchor-based positional encoding scheme for graph representation. Our approach strategically selects reference nodes as anchors and encodes each node's position relative to these anchors, capturing essential topological information without the computational burden of existing methods. Notably, we identify and address a fundamental issue: the inherent misalignment between discrete hop-based distances in graphs and continuous distances in embedding spaces. By implementing a rank-preserving objective for positional encoding pretraining, NT-LLM achieves superior performance across diverse graph tasks ranging from basic structural analysis to complex reasoning scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that this lightweight yet powerful approach effectively enhances LLMs' ability to understand and reason with graph-structured information, offering an efficient solution for graph-based applications of language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

While decomposition-integrated approaches like variational mode graph convolutional network (VMGCN) improve accuracy through signal decomposition, they suffer from computational inefficiency and manual hyperparameter tuning. To address these limitations, we propose the mode adaptive graph network (MAGN) that transforms iterative variational mode decomposition (VMD) into a trainable neural module. Our key innovations include (1) an unfolded VMD (UVMD) module that replaces iterative optimization with a fixed-depth network to reduce the decomposition time (by 250x for the LargeST benchmark), and (2) mode-specific learnable bandwidth constraints ({\alpha}k ) adapt spatial heterogeneity and eliminate manual tuning while preventing spectral overlap. Evaluated on the LargeST benchmark (6,902 sensors, 241M observations), MAGN achieves an 85-95% reduction in the prediction error over VMGCN and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review in IEEE Signal Processing Letter</p></details> |

We show how simple graph neural networks can be designed to jointly learn the interaction rules and the latent heterogeneity from observable dynamics. The learned latent heterogeneity and dynamics can be used to virtually decompose the complex system which is necessary to infer and parameterize the underlying governing equations. We tested the approach with simulation experiments of interacting moving particles, vector fields, and signaling networks. While our current aim is to better understand and validate the approach with simulated data, we anticipate it to become a generally applicable tool to uncover the governing rules underlying complex dynamics observed in nature.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 2 pages appendix, 2 supplementary tables, 18 supplementary figures, 14 videos linked to YouTube</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Parsing for Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06772v3)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel method for question answering over knowledge graphs based on graph-to-segment mapping, designed to improve the understanding of natural language questions. Our approach is grounded in semantic parsing, a key technique for interpreting question utterances. The main challenges arise from handling implicit entities and relations, as well as complex constraints such as temporal conditions, ordinality, and aggregation within the context of a knowledge graph. To address these issues, our framework integrates both rule-based and neural methods to parse and construct accurate, comprehensive semantic segment sequences. These sequences are then assembled into semantic query graphs, providing precise representations of question utterances. We formulate question semantic parsing as a sequence generation task, employing an encoder-decoder neural network to map natural language questions into semantic segments. Furthermore, to enhance the identification of implicit entities and relations, we incorporate a graph neural network that leverages knowledge graph context to enrich question representations. Experimental evaluations on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of our model in semantic parsing for knowledge graph question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient GNNs-to-KANs Distillation via Self-Attention Dynamic Sampling with Potential for Consumer Electronics Edge Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00560v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) is crucial for deploying deep learning models in resource-constrained edge environments, particularly within the consumer electronics sector, including smart home devices, wearable technology, and mobile terminals. These applications place higher demands on model compression and inference speed, necessitating the transfer of knowledge from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to more efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. However, due to their fixed activation functions and fully connected architecture, MLPs face challenges in rapidly capturing the complex neighborhood dependencies learned by GNNs, thereby limiting their performance in edge environments. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative from GNNs to Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) knowledge distillation framework-Self Attention Dynamic Sampling Distillation (SA-DSD). This study improved Fourier KAN (FR-KAN) and replaced MLP with the improved FR-KAN+ as the student model. Through the incorporation of learnable frequency bases and phase-shift mechanisms, along with algorithmic optimization, FR-KAN significantly improves its nonlinear fitting capability while effectively reducing computational complexity. Building on this, a margin-level sampling probability matrix, based on teacher-student prediction consistency, is constructed, and an adaptive weighted loss mechanism is designed to mitigate performance degradation in the student model due to the lack of explicit neighborhood aggregation. Extensive experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SA-DSD achieves performance improvements of 3.05%-3.62% over three GNN teacher models and 15.61% over the FR-KAN+ model. Moreover, when compared with key benchmark models, SA-DSD achieves a 16.96x reduction in parameter count and a 55.75% decrease in inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Curriculum Guided Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00402v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subgraph Federated Learning (FL) aims to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) across distributed private subgraphs, but it suffers from severe data heterogeneity. To mitigate data heterogeneity, weighted model aggregation personalizes each local GNN by assigning larger weights to parameters from clients with similar subgraph characteristics inferred from their current model states. However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid overfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even collapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce their own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available. To this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called Curriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the client side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges for training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first to easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder, client-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased patterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization, the curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic knowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves weighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained structural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that CUFL achieves superior performance compared to relevant baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/Kang-Min-Ku/CUFL.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the CIKM 2025.

| **[Unifying Adversarial Perturbation for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00387v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to adversarial attacks on node features and graph structure. Various methods have implemented adversarial training to augment graph data, aiming to bolster the robustness and generalization of GNNs. These methods typically involve applying perturbations to the node feature, weights, or graph structure and subsequently minimizing the loss by learning more robust graph model parameters under the adversarial perturbations. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial training in enhancing GNNs' robustness and generalization abilities, its application has been largely confined to specific datasets and GNN types. In this paper, we propose a novel method, PerturbEmbedding, that integrates adversarial perturbation and training, enhancing GNNs' resilience to such attacks and improving their generalization ability. PerturbEmbedding performs perturbation operations directly on every hidden embedding of GNNs and provides a unified framework for most existing perturbation strategies/methods. We also offer a unified perspective on the forms of perturbations, namely random and adversarial perturbations. Through experiments on various datasets using different backbone models, we demonstrate that PerturbEmbedding significantly improves both the robustness and generalization abilities of GNNs, outperforming existing methods. The rejection of both random (non-targeted) and adversarial (targeted) perturbations further enhances the backbone model's performance.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, given an input image, the model must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling), and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization). Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning (SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDM 2025</p></details> |

However, their performance degrades sharply on harder instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations. We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.</p></details> | Preprint |

While CP algorithms have evolved beyond traditional classifiers and regressors to sophisticated deep learning models like deep neural networks (DNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and large language models (LLMs), existing CP libraries often lack the model support and scalability for large-scale DL scenarios. This paper introduces TorchCP, a PyTorch-native library designed to integrate state-of-the-art CP algorithms into deep learning techniques, including DNN-based classifier/regressor, GNN, and LLM. Released under the LGPL-3.0 license, TorchCP comprises about 16k lines of code, validated with 100% unit test coverage and detailed documentation. Notably, TorchCP enables CP-specific training algorithms, online prediction, and GPU-accelerated batch processing, achieving up to 90% reduction in inference time on large datasets. With its low-coupling design, comprehensive suite of advanced methods, and full GPU scalability, TorchCP empowers researchers and practitioners to enhance uncertainty quantification across cutting-edge applications.</p></details> |  |

We review current state-of-the-art molecular ML models and discuss research directions that promise further advancements. This includes ML methods, such as graph neural networks and transformers, which can be further advanced through the incorporation of physicochemical knowledge in a hybrid or physics-informed fashion. Then, we consider leveraging molecular ML at the chemical process scale, which is highly desirable yet rather unexplored. We discuss how molecular ML can be integrated into process design and optimization formulations, promising to accelerate the identification of novel molecules and processes. To this end, it will be essential to create molecule and process design benchmarks and practically validate proposed candidates, possibly in collaboration with the chemical industry.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Mixture of Experts Gating Network for Enhanced Surrogate Modeling in External Aerodynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21249v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy, assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2 prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.</p></details> |  |

The training dataset was constructed through an automated framework that integrated geometry generation, meshing, and flow-field solutions in ANSYS Fluent. The pin-fin geometry was parameterized using piecewise cubic splines, producing 1,000 diverse configurations through Latin Hypercube Sampling. Each simulation was converted into a graph structure, where nodes carried a feature vector containing spatial coordinates, a normalized streamwise position, one-hot boundary indicators, and a signed distance to the nearest boundary such as wall. This graph structure served as input to the newly developed Graph Neural Network, which was trained to predict temperature, velocity magnitude, and pressure at each node using data from ANSYS. The network predicted fields with outstanding accuracy, capturing boundary layers, recirculation, and the stagnation region upstream of the pin-fins while reducing wall time by 2-3 orders of magnitude. In conclusion, the novel graph neural network offered a fast and reliable surrogate for simulations in complex flow configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Based Feature Augmentation for Predictive Tasks on Relational Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20986v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data has become a foundational asset driving innovation across domains such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In these areas, predictive modeling over relational tables is commonly employed, with increasing emphasis on reducing manual effort through automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques. This raises an interesting question: can feature augmentation itself be automated and identify and utilize task-related relational signals? To address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end automated feature augmentation framework, ReCoGNN, which enhances initial datasets using features extracted from multiple relational tables to support predictive tasks. ReCoGNN first captures semantic dependencies within each table by modeling intra-table attribute relationships, enabling it to partition tables into structured, semantically coherent segments. It then constructs a heterogeneous weighted graph that represents inter-row relationships across all segments. Finally, ReCoGNN leverages message-passing graph neural networks to propagate information through the graph, guiding feature selection and augmenting the original dataset. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-life and synthetic datasets demonstrate that ReCoGNN consistently outperforms existing methods on both classification and regression tasks.</p></details> |  |
