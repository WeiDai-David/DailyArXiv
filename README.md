| **[AI-Generated Text is Non-Stationary: Detection via Temporal Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01754v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of AI-generated text detection has evolved from supervised classification to zero-shot statistical analysis. However, current approaches share a fundamental limitation: they aggregate token-level measurements into scalar scores, discarding positional information about where anomalies occur. Our empirical analysis reveals that AI-generated text exhibits significant non-stationarity, statistical properties vary by 73.8\% more between text segments compared to human writing. This discovery explains why existing detectors fail against localized adversarial perturbations that exploit this overlooked characteristic. We introduce Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT), a novel detection paradigm that preserves positional information by reformulating detection as a signal processing task. TDT treats token-level discrepancies as a time-series signal and applies Continuous Wavelet Transform to generate a two-dimensional time-scale representation, capturing both the location and linguistic scale of statistical anomalies. On the RAID benchmark, TDT achieves 0.855 AUROC (7.1\% improvement over the best baseline). More importantly, TDT demonstrates robust performance on adversarial tasks, with 14.1\% AUROC improvement on HART Level 2 paraphrasing attacks. Despite its sophisticated analysis, TDT maintains practical efficiency with only 13\% computational overhead. Our work establishes non-stationarity as a fundamental characteristic of AI-generated text and demonstrates that preserving temporal dynamics is essential for robust detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal tail coefficient for compound extremes in multivariate time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19007v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme events are often multivariate in nature. A compound extreme occurs when a combination of variables jointly produces a significant impact, even if individual components are not necessarily marginally extreme. Compound extremes have been observed across a wide range of domains, including space weather, climate, and environmental science. For example, heavy rainfall sustained over consecutive days can impose cumulative stress on urban drainage systems, potentially resulting in flooding. However, most existing methods for detecting extremal causality focus primarily on individual extreme values and lack the flexibility to capture causal relationships between compound extremes. This work introduces a novel framework for detecting causal dependencies between extreme events, including compound extremes. We introduce the compound causal tail coefficient that captures the extremal dependance of compound events between pairs of stationary time series. Based on a consistent estimator of this coefficient, we develop a bootstrap hypothesis test to evaluate the presence and direction of causal relationships. Our method can accommodate nonlinearity and latent confounding variables. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by establishing theoretic properties and through simulation studies and an application to space-weather data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Injecting Explainability and Lightweight Design into Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20201v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly Supervised Monitoring Anomaly Detection (WSMAD) utilizes weak supervision learning to identify anomalies, a critical task for smart city monitoring. However, existing multimodal approaches often fail to meet the real-time and interpretability requirements of edge devices due to their complexity. This paper presents TCVADS (Two-stage Cross-modal Video Anomaly Detection System), which leverages knowledge distillation and cross-modal contrastive learning to enable efficient, accurate, and interpretable anomaly detection on edge devices.TCVADS operates in two stages: coarse-grained rapid classification and fine-grained detailed analysis. In the first stage, TCVADS extracts features from video frames and inputs them into a time series analysis module, which acts as the teacher model. Insights are then transferred via knowledge distillation to a simplified convolutional network (student model) for binary classification. Upon detecting an anomaly, the second stage is triggered, employing a fine-grained multi-class classification model. This stage uses CLIP for cross-modal contrastive learning with text and images, enhancing interpretability and achieving refined classification through specially designed triplet textual relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that TCVADS significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance, detection efficiency, and interpretability, offering valuable contributions to smart city monitoring applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Information Visualization - A Review of Approaches and Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14920v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data are prevalent across various domains and often encompass large datasets containing multiple time-dependent features in each sample. Exploring time-varying data is critical for data science practitioners aiming to understand dynamic behaviors and discover periodic patterns and trends. However, the analysis of such data often requires sophisticated procedures and tools. Information visualization is a communication channel that leverages human perceptual abilities to transform abstract data into visual representations. Visualization techniques have been successfully applied in the context of time series to enhance interpretability by graphically representing the temporal evolution of data. The challenge for information visualization developers lies in integrating a wide range of analytical tools into rich visualization systems that can summarize complex datasets while clearly describing the impacts of the temporal component. Such systems enable data scientists to turn raw data into understandable and potentially useful knowledge. This review examines techniques and approaches designed for handling time series data, guiding users through knowledge discovery processes based on visual analysis. We also provide readers with theoretical insights and design guidelines for considering when developing comprehensive information visualization approaches for time series, with a particular focus on time series with multiple features. As a result, we highlight the challenges and future research directions to address open questions in the visualization of time-dependent data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

| **[MOMEMTO: Patch-based Memory Gate Model in Time Series Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18751v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently reconstruction-based deep models have been widely used for time series anomaly detection, but as their capacity and representation capability increase, these models tend to over-generalize, often reconstructing unseen anomalies accurately. Prior works have attempted to mitigate this by incorporating a memory architecture that stores prototypes of normal patterns. Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from high training costs and have yet to be effectively integrated with time series foundation models (TFMs). To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MOMEMTO}, a TFM for anomaly detection, enhanced with a patch-based memory module to mitigate over-generalization. The memory module is designed to capture representative normal patterns from multiple domains and enables a single model to be jointly fine-tuned across multiple datasets through a multi-domain training strategy. MOMEMTO initializes memory items with latent representations from a pre-trained encoder, organizes them into patch-level units, and updates them via an attention mechanism. We evaluate our method using 23 univariate benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MOMEMTO, as a single model, achieves higher scores on AUC and VUS metrics compared to baseline methods, and further enhances the performance of its backbone TFM, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recent advances in data-driven methods for degradation modelling across applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18164v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding degradation is crucial for ensuring the longevity and performance of materials, systems, and organisms.

| **[Q-DPTS: Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting via Variational Quantum Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05036v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is vital in domains where data sensitivity is paramount, such as finance and energy systems. While Differential Privacy (DP) provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA, QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower prediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work presents one of the first explorations into quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting, offering promising directions for secure and accurate time series modeling in privacy-critical scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Quantum and Classical Sequential Models for Urban Telecommunication Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04488v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we evaluate the performance of classical and quantum-inspired sequential models in forecasting univariate time series of incoming SMS activity (SMS-in) using the Milan Telecommunication Activity Dataset. Due to data completeness limitations, we focus exclusively on the SMS-in signal for each spatial grid cell. We compare five models, LSTM (baseline), Quantum LSTM (QLSTM), Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention (QASA), Quantum Receptance Weighted Key-Value (QRWKV), and Quantum Fast Weight Programmers (QFWP), under varying input sequence lengths (4, 8, 12, 16, 32 and 64). All models are trained to predict the next 10-minute SMS-in value based solely on historical values within a given sequence window. Our findings indicate that different models exhibit varying sensitivities to sequence length, suggesting that quantum enhancements are not universally advantageous. Rather, the effectiveness of quantum modules is highly dependent on the specific task and architectural design, reflecting inherent trade-offs among model size, parameterization strategies, and temporal modeling capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[DS-Diffusion: Data Style-Guided Diffusion Model for Time-Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18584v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are the mainstream approach for time series generation tasks. However, existing diffusion models for time series generation require retraining the entire framework to introduce specific conditional guidance. There also exists a certain degree of distributional bias between the generated data and the real data, which leads to potential model biases in downstream tasks. Additionally, the complexity of diffusion models and the latent spaces leads to an uninterpretable inference process. To address these issues, we propose the data style-guided diffusion model (DS-Diffusion). In the DS-Diffusion, a diffusion framework based on style-guided kernels is developed to avoid retraining for specific conditions. The time-information based hierarchical denoising mechanism (THD) is developed to reduce the distributional bias between the generated data and the real data. Furthermore, the generated samples can clearly indicate the data style from which they originate. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using multiple public datasets to validate our approach. Experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art model such as ImagenTime, the predictive score and the discriminative score decrease by 5.56% and 61.55%, respectively. The distributional bias between the generated data and the real data is further reduced, the inference process is also more interpretable. Moreover, by eliminating the need to retrain the diffusion model, the flexibility and adaptability of the model to specific conditions are also enhanced.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-informed time series analysis with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks under Ehrenfest constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18483v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prediction of quantum dynamical responses lies at the heart of modern physics. Yet, modeling these time-dependent behaviors remains a formidable challenge because quantum systems evolve in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, often rendering traditional numerical methods computationally prohibitive. While large language models have achieved remarkable success in sequential prediction, quantum dynamics presents a fundamentally different challenge: forecasting the entire temporal evolution of quantum systems rather than merely the next element in a sequence. Existing neural architectures such as recurrent and convolutional networks often require vast training datasets and suffer from spurious oscillations that compromise physical interpretability. In this work, we introduce a fundamentally new approach: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) augmented with physics-informed loss functions that enforce the Ehrenfest theorems. Our method achieves superior accuracy with significantly less training data: it requires only 5.4 percent of the samples (200) compared to Temporal Convolution Networks (3,700). We further introduce the Chain of KANs, a novel architecture that embeds temporal causality directly into the model design, making it particularly well-suited for time series modeling. Our results demonstrate that physics-informed KANs offer a compelling advantage over conventional black-box models, maintaining both mathematical rigor and physical consistency while dramatically reducing data requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIDMAD: Time Series Dataset for Discovering Dark Matter with AI Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04378v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dark matter makes up approximately 85% of total matter in our universe, yet it has never been directly observed in any laboratory on Earth. The origin of dark matter is one of the most important questions in contemporary physics, and a convincing detection of dark matter would be a Nobel-Prize-level breakthrough in fundamental science. The ABRACADABRA experiment was specifically designed to search for dark matter. Although it has not yet made a discovery, ABRACADABRA has produced several dark matter search results widely endorsed by the physics community. The experiment generates ultra-long time-series data at a rate of 10 million samples per second, where the dark matter signal would manifest itself as a sinusoidal oscillation mode within the ultra-long time series. In this paper, we present the TIDMAD -- a comprehensive data release from the ABRACADABRA experiment including three key components: an ultra-long time series dataset divided into training, validation, and science subsets; a carefully-designed denoising score for direct model benchmarking; and a complete analysis framework which produces a community-standard dark matter search result suitable for publication as a physics paper. This data release enables core AI algorithms to extract the signal and produce real physics results thereby advancing fundamental science. The data downloading and associated analysis scripts are available at https://github.com/jessicafry/TIDMAD</p></details> |  |
| **["What is Different Between These Datasets?" A Framework for Explaining Data Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05652v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of machine learning models relies heavily on the quality of input data, yet real-world applications often face significant data-related challenges. A common issue arises when curating training data or deploying models: two datasets from the same domain may exhibit differing distributions. While many techniques exist for detecting such distribution shifts, there is a lack of comprehensive methods to explain these differences in a human-understandable way beyond opaque quantitative metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a versatile framework of interpretable methods for comparing datasets. Using a variety of case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across diverse data modalities-including tabular data, text data, images, time-series signals -- in both low and high-dimensional settings. These methods complement existing techniques by providing actionable and interpretable insights to better understand and address distribution shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cointegration with Occasionally Binding Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09604v4)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the literature on nonlinear cointegration, a long-standing open problem relates to how a (nonlinear) vector autoregression, which provides a unified description of the short- and long-run dynamics of a vector of time series, can generate 'nonlinear cointegration' in the profound sense of those series sharing common nonlinear stochastic trends. We consider this problem in the setting of the censored and kinked structural VAR (CKSVAR), which provides a flexible yet tractable framework within which to model time series that are subject to threshold-type nonlinearities, such as those arising due to occasionally binding constraints, of which the zero lower bound (ZLB) on short-term nominal interest rates provides a leading example. We provide a complete characterisation of how common linear and nonlinear stochastic trends may be generated in this model, via unit roots and appropriate generalisations of the usual rank conditions, providing the first extension to date of the Granger-Johansen representation theorem to a nonlinearly cointegrated setting, and thereby giving the first successful treatment of the open problem. The limiting common trend processes include regulated, censored and kinked Brownian motions, none of which have previously appeared in the literature on cointegrated VARs. Our results and running examples illustrate that the CKSVAR is capable of supporting a far richer variety of long-run behaviour than is a linear VAR, in ways that may be particularly useful for the identification of structural parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>ii + ...</summary><p>ii + 58 pp., 4 figures; author accepted manuscript</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP): A Distribution-Free Statistical and Machine Learning Framework for Adaptive Risk Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05470v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP), a distribution-free framework for constructing well-calibrated prediction intervals in nonstationary time series. TCP combines a quantile forecaster with split-conformal calibration on a rolling window and, in its TCP-RM variant, augments the conformal threshold with a Robbins-Monro (RM) offset to steer coverage toward a target level in real time. We benchmark TCP against GARCH, Historical Simulation, and a rolling Quantile Regression (QR) baseline across equities (S&P500), cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), and commodities (Gold). Three consistent findings emerge. First, rolling QR produces the sharpest intervals but is materially under-calibrated (e.g., S&P500: 86.3% vs. 95% target). Second, TCP and TCP-RM achieve near-nominal coverage while delivering substantially narrower intervals than Historical Simulation (e.g., S&P500: 29% reduction in width). Third, the RM update improves calibration with negligible width cost. Crisis-window visualizations around March 2020 show TCP/TCP-RM expanding and contracting intervals promptly as volatility spikes and recedes, with red dots marking days of miscoverage. A sensitivity study confirms robustness to window size and step-size choices. Overall, TCP provides a practical, theoretically grounded solution for calibrated uncertainty quantification under distribution shift, bridging statistical inference and machine learning for risk forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Multi-entity, Multivariate Quickest Change Point Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18310v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a framework for online Change Point Detection (CPD) from multi-entity, multivariate time series data, motivated by applications in crowd monitoring where traditional sensing methods (e.g., video surveillance) may be infeasible. Our approach addresses the challenge of detecting system-wide behavioral shifts in complex, dynamic environments where the number and behavior of individual entities may be uncertain or evolve. We introduce the concept of Individual Deviation from Normality (IDfN), computed via a reconstruction-error-based autoencoder trained on normal behavior. We aggregate these individual deviations using mean, variance, and Kernel Density Estimates (KDE) to yield a System-Wide Anomaly Score (SWAS). To detect persistent or abrupt changes, we apply statistical deviation metrics and the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) technique to these scores. Our unsupervised approach eliminates the need for labeled data or feature extraction, enabling real-time operation on streaming input. Evaluations on both synthetic datasets and crowd simulations, explicitly designed for anomaly detection in group behaviors, demonstrate that our method accurately detects significant system-level changes, offering a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for monitoring complex multi-agent systems. In addition to this methodological contribution, we introduce new, challenging multi-entity multivariate time series datasets generated from crowd simulations in Unity and coupled nonlinear oscillators. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no publicly available dataset of this type designed explicitly to evaluate CPD in complex collective and interactive systems, highlighting an essential gap that our work addresses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Budgeted Adversarial Attack against Graph-Based Anomaly Detection in Sensor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17987v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for anomaly detection in sensor networks, particularly when analyzing multivariate time series. In this work, we introduce BETA, a novel grey-box evasion attack targeting such GNN-based detectors, where the attacker is constrained to perturb sensor readings from a limited set of nodes, excluding the target sensor, with the goal of either suppressing a true anomaly or triggering a false alarm at the target node. BETA identifies the sensors most influential to the target node's classification and injects carefully crafted adversarial perturbations into their features, all while maintaining stealth and respecting the attacker's budget. Experiments on three real-world sensor network datasets show that BETA reduces the detection accuracy of state-of-the-art GNN-based detectors by 30.62 to 39.16% on average, and significantly outperforms baseline attack strategies, while operating within realistic constraints.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Covariance-Corrected WAIC for Bayesian Sequential Data Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17980v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces and develops a theoretical extension of the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC), called the Covariance-Corrected WAIC (CC-WAIC), that applied for Bayesian sequential data models. The CC-WAIC accounts for temporal or structural dependence by incorporating the full posterior covariance structure of the log-likelihood contributions, in contrast to the classical WAIC that assumes conditional independence among data. We exploit the limitations of classical WAIC in the sequential data contexts and derive the CC-WAIC criterion under a theoretical framework. In addition, we propose a bias correction based on effective sample size to improve estimation from Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Furthermore, we highlight the advantages of CC-WAIC in terms of stability and appropriateness for dependent data. This new criterion is supported by formal mathematical derivations, illustrative examples, and discussion of implications for model selection in both classical and modern Bayesian applications. To evaluate the reliability of CC-WAIC under varying data regimes, we conduct simulation experiments across multiple time series lengths (small, medium, and large) and different levels of temporal dependence, enabling a comprehensive performance assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 tables, 1 figure, Preprint</p></details> |
| **[StefaLand: An Efficient Geoscience Foundation Model That Improves Dynamic Land-Surface Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17942v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stewarding natural resources, mitigating floods, droughts, wildfires, and landslides, and meeting growing demands require models that can predict climate-driven land-surface responses and human feedback with high accuracy. Traditional impact models, whether process-based, statistical, or machine learning, struggle with spatial generalization due to limited observations and concept drift. Recently proposed vision foundation models trained on satellite imagery demand massive compute and are ill-suited for dynamic land-surface prediction. We introduce StefaLand, a generative spatiotemporal earth foundation model centered on landscape interactions. StefaLand improves predictions on three tasks and four datasets: streamflow, soil moisture, and soil composition, compared to prior state-of-the-art. Results highlight its ability to generalize across diverse, data-scarce regions and support broad land-surface applications. The model builds on a masked autoencoder backbone that learns deep joint representations of landscape attributes, with a location-aware architecture fusing static and time-series inputs, attribute-based representations that drastically reduce compute, and residual fine-tuning adapters that enhance transfer. While inspired by prior methods, their alignment with geoscience and integration in one model enables robust performance on dynamic land-surface tasks. StefaLand can be pretrained and finetuned on academic compute yet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and even fine-tuned vision foundation models. To our knowledge, this is the first geoscience land-surface foundation model that demonstrably improves dynamic land-surface interaction predictions and supports diverse downstream applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conv-like Scale-Fusion Time Series Transformer: A Multi-Scale Representation for Variable-Length Long Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17845v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis faces significant challenges in handling variable-length data and achieving robust generalization. While Transformer-based models have advanced time series tasks, they often struggle with feature redundancy and limited generalization capabilities. Drawing inspiration from classical CNN architectures' pyramidal structure, we propose a Multi-Scale Representation Learning Framework based on a Conv-like ScaleFusion Transformer. Our approach introduces a temporal convolution-like structure that combines patching operations with multi-head attention, enabling progressive temporal dimension compression and feature channel expansion. We further develop a novel cross-scale attention mechanism for effective feature fusion across different temporal scales, along with a log-space normalization method for variable-length sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior feature independence, reduced redundancy, and better performance in forecasting and classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[MTM: A Multi-Scale Token Mixing Transformer for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17809v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) is characterized by the lack of synchronized observations across its different channels. In this paper, we point out that this channel-wise asynchrony can lead to poor channel-wise modeling of existing deep learning methods. To overcome this limitation, we propose MTM, a multi-scale token mixing transformer for the classification of IMTS. We find that the channel-wise asynchrony can be alleviated by down-sampling the time series to coarser timescales, and propose to incorporate a masked concat pooling in MTM that gradually down-samples IMTS to enhance the channel-wise attention modules. Meanwhile, we propose a novel channel-wise token mixing mechanism which proactively chooses important tokens from one channel and mixes them with other channels, to further boost the channel-wise learning of our model. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets and comparison with state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate that MTM consistently achieves the best performance on all the benchmarks, with improvements of up to 3.8% in AUPRC for classification.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |
| **[TS-P$^2$CL: Plug-and-Play Dual Contrastive Learning for Vision-Guided Medical Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17802v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical time series (MedTS) classification is pivotal for intelligent healthcare, yet its efficacy is severely limited by poor cross-subject generation due to the profound cross-individual heterogeneity. Despite advances in architectural innovations and transfer learning techniques, current methods remain constrained by modality-specific inductive biases that limit their ability to learn universally invariant representations. To overcome this, we propose TS-P$^2$CL, a novel plug-and-play framework that leverages the universal pattern recognition capabilities of pre-trained vision models. We introduce a vision-guided paradigm that transforms 1D physiological signals into 2D pseudo-images, establishing a bridge to the visual domain. This transformation enables implicit access to rich semantic priors learned from natural images. Within this unified space, we employ a dual-contrastive learning strategy: intra-modal consistency enforces temporal coherence, while cross-modal alignment aligns time-series dynamics with visual semantics, thereby mitigating individual-specific biases and learning robust, domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments on six MedTS datasets demonstrate that TS-P$^2$CL consistently outperforms fourteen methods in both subject-dependent and subject-independent settings.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Full-History Graphs with Edge-Type Decoupled Networks for Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03251v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling evolving interactions among entities is critical in many real-world tasks. For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i) intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii) inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines, lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++ illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single graph.</p></details> | <details><summary>Europ...</summary><p>European Conference of Artificial Intelligence 2025</p></details> |
| **[STRATA-TS: Selective Knowledge Transfer for Urban Time Series Forecasting with Retrieval-Guided Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18635v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban forecasting models often face a severe data imbalance problem: only a few cities have dense, long-span records, while many others expose short or incomplete histories. Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is unreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the target domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and negative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware retrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval with reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data regimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source subsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target query. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided reasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs and retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning process into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore, Nottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms strong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable knowledge transfer pathways.</p></details> |  |

These models generate observable time series driven by evolving, partially-latent microstates. Latent states need to be estimated to align simulations with real-world data -- a task traditionally addressed by DA, especially in continuous and equation-based models such as those used in weather forecasting. However, the nature of ABMs poses challenges for standard DA methods. Solving such issues requires adaptation of previous DA techniques, or ad-hoc alternatives such as LBI. DA approximates the likelihood in a model-agnostic way, making it broadly applicable but potentially less precise. In contrast, LBI provides more accurate state estimation by directly leveraging the model's likelihood, but at the cost of requiring a hand-crafted, model-specific likelihood function, which may be complex or infeasible to derive. We compare the two methods on the Bounded-Confidence Model, a well-known opinion dynamics ABM, where agents are affected only by others holding sufficiently similar opinions. We find that LBI better recovers latent agent-level opinions, even under model mis-specification, leading to improved individual-level forecasts. At the aggregate level, however, both methods perform comparably, and DA remains competitive across levels of aggregation under certain parameter settings. Our findings suggest that DA is well-suited for aggregate predictions, while LBI is preferable for agent-level inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Periodic Graph-Enhanced Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17472v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection commonly encounters in various domains like finance, healthcare, and industrial monitoring. However, existing MTS anomaly detection methods are mostly defined on the static graph structure, which fails to perform an accurate representation of complex spatio-temporal correlations in MTS. To address this issue, this study proposes a Periodic Graph-Enhanced Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detector (PGMA) with the following two-fold ideas: a) designing a periodic time-slot allocation strategy based Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which enables the graph structure to reflect dynamic changes in MTS; b) utilizing graph neural network and temporal extension convolution to accurate extract the complex spatio-temporal correlations from the reconstructed periodic graphs. Experiments on four real datasets from real applications demonstrate that the proposed PGMA outperforms state-of-the-art models in MTS anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer -- Towards Foundational Digital Twins in Process Industry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13111v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational modelling of multi-dimensional time-series data in industrial systems presents a central trade-off: channel-dependent (CD) models capture specific cross-variable dynamics but lack robustness and adaptability as model layers are commonly bound to the data dimensionality of the tackled use-case, while channel-independent (CI) models offer generality at the cost of modelling the explicit interactions crucial for system-level predictive regression tasks. To resolve this, we propose the Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer (CGPT), a novel architecture that integrates a known causal graph as an inductive bias. The core of CGPT is built around a pairwise modeling paradigm, tackling the CD/CI conflict by decomposing the multidimensional data into pairs. The model uses channel-agnostic learnable layers where all parameter dimensions are independent of the number of variables. CGPT enforces a CD information flow at the pair-level and CI-like generalization across pairs. This approach disentangles complex system dynamics and results in a highly flexible architecture that ensures scalability and any-variate adaptability. We validate CGPT on a suite of synthetic and real-world industrial datasets on long-term and one-step forecasting tasks designed to simulate common industrial complexities. Results demonstrate that CGPT significantly outperforms both CI and CD baselines in predictive accuracy and shows competitive performance with end-to-end trained CD models while remaining agnostic to the problem dimensionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures (1 figure updated), 4 tables</p></details> |

While often viewed as impairments to reliable data transmission, this work introduces a paradigm shift by reconceptualizing these intrinsic physical properties as computational resources. We frame a canonical point-to-point MC channel, comprising ligand diffusion and reversible ligand-receptor binding at a spherical receiver, as a Physical Reservoir Computer (PRC). Utilizing deterministic mean-field modeling and particle-based spatial stochastic simulations, we demonstrate the MC system's inherent capability for complex temporal information processing on standard chaotic time-series benchmarks. We comprehensively evaluate performance using both task-specific Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) and the task-independent Information Processing Capacity (IPC). Our results reveal a non-monotonic dependence of computational power on key biophysical parameters (receptor kinetic rates, diffusion coefficient, and transmitter-receiver distance), identifying optimal operational regimes where memory and nonlinearity are balanced. These findings establish the MC channel as a viable computational substrate, paving the way for novel architectures in \emph{wetware} artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prospective Multi-Graph Cohesion for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17235v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in high-dimensional time series data is pivotal for numerous industrial applications. Recent advances in multivariate time series anomaly detection (TSAD) have increasingly leveraged graph structures to model inter-variable relationships, typically employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Despite their promising results, existing methods often rely on a single graph representation, which are insufficient for capturing the complex, diverse relationships inherent in multivariate time series. To address this, we propose the Prospective Multi-Graph Cohesion (PMGC) framework for multivariate TSAD. PMGC exploits spatial correlations by integrating a long-term static graph with a series of short-term instance-wise dynamic graphs, regulated through a graph cohesion loss function. Our theoretical analysis shows that this loss function promotes diversity among dynamic graphs while aligning them with the stable long-term relationships encapsulated by the static graph. Additionally, we introduce a "prospective graphing" strategy to mitigate the limitations of traditional forecasting-based TSAD methods, which often struggle with unpredictable future variations. This strategy allows the model to accurately reflect concurrent inter-series relationships under normal conditions, thereby enhancing anomaly detection efficacy. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing TSAD techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 18th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (ACM WSDM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Past and Future: Distribution-Aware Alignment for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14181v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although contrastive and other representation-learning methods have long been explored in vision and NLP, their adoption in modern time series forecasters remains limited. We believe they hold strong promise for this domain. To unlock this potential, we explicitly align past and future representations, thereby bridging the distributional gap between input histories and future targets. To this end, we introduce TimeAlign, a lightweight, plug-and-play framework that establishes a new representation paradigm, distinct from contrastive learning, by aligning auxiliary features via a simple reconstruction task and feeding them back into any base forecaster. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify its superior performance. Further studies indicate that the gains arise primarily from correcting frequency mismatches between historical inputs and future outputs. Additionally, we provide two theoretical justifications for how reconstruction improves forecasting generalization and how alignment increases the mutual information between learned representations and predicted targets. The code is available at https://github.com/TROUBADOUR000/TimeAlign.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Forecasting Using a Hybrid Deep Learning Method: A Bi-LSTM Embedding Denoising Auto Encoder Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17165v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data is a prevalent form of data found in various fields. It consists of a series of measurements taken over time. Forecasting is a crucial application of time series models, where future values are predicted based on historical data. Accurate forecasting is essential for making well-informed decisions across industries. When it comes to electric vehicles (EVs), precise predictions play a key role in planning infrastructure development, load balancing, and energy management. This study introduces a BI-LSTM embedding denoising autoencoder model (BDM) designed to address time series problems, focusing on short-term EV charging load prediction. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by comparing it with benchmark models like Transformer, CNN, RNN, LSTM, and GRU. Based on the results of the study, the proposed model outperforms the benchmark models in four of the five-time steps, demonstrating its effectiveness for time series forecasting. This research makes a significant contribution to enhancing time series forecasting, thereby improving decision-making processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-scale clustering and source separation of InSight mission seismic data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16189v5)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised source separation involves unraveling an unknown set of source signals recorded through a mixing operator, with limited prior knowledge about the sources, and only access to a dataset of signal mixtures. This problem is inherently ill-posed and is further challenged by the variety of timescales exhibited by sources in time series data from planetary space missions. As such, a systematic multi-scale unsupervised approach is needed to identify and separate sources at different timescales. Existing methods typically rely on a preselected window size that determines their operating timescale, limiting their capacity to handle multi-scale sources. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised multi-scale clustering and source separation framework by leveraging wavelet scattering spectra that provide a low-dimensional representation of stochastic processes, capable of distinguishing between different non-Gaussian stochastic processes. Nested within this representation space, we develop a factorial variational autoencoder that is trained to probabilistically cluster sources at different timescales. To perform source separation, we use samples from clusters at multiple timescales obtained via the factorial variational autoencoder as prior information and formulate an optimization problem in the wavelet scattering spectra representation space. When applied to the entire seismic dataset recorded during the NASA InSight mission on Mars, containing sources varying greatly in timescale, our approach disentangles such different sources, e.g., minute-long transient one-sided pulses (known as "glitches") and structured ambient noises resulting from atmospheric activities that typically last for tens of minutes, and provides an opportunity to conduct further investigations into the isolated sources.</p></details> |  |

Based on a long time-series perspective, this paper explores uncertainties in the realms of renewable power and deep learning. Then, an uncertainty-aware model is meticulously designed for renewable scenario forecasting, which leverages an attention mechanism and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to precisely capture complex spatial-temporal dynamics. To improve the interpretability of uncertain behavior in RES generation, Bayesian deep learning and adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) are incorporated to simulate typical patterns and variations. Additionally, the integration of meteorological information, forecasts, and historical trajectories in the processing layer improves the synergistic forecasting capability for multiscale periodic regularities. Numerical experiments and case analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach provides an appropriate interpretation for renewable uncertainty representation, including both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and shows superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes a machine learning-based load shedding framework for the University of Lagos, designed to optimize distribution and reduce waste. The methodology followed three main stages. First, a dataset of 3,648 hourly records from 55 buildings was compiled to develop building-level consumption models. Second, Principal Component Analysis was applied for dimensionality reduction, and clustering validation techniques were used to determine the optimal number of demand groups. Mini-Batch K-Means was then employed to classify buildings into high-, medium-, and low-demand clusters. Finally, short-term load forecasting was performed at the cluster level using multiple statistical and deep learning models, including ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, and GRU. Results showed Prophet offered the most reliable forecasts, while Mini-Batch K-Means achieved stable clustering performance. By integrating clustering with forecasting, the framework enabled a fairer, data-driven load shedding strategy that reduces inefficiencies and supports climate change mitigation through sustainable energy management.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for the NeurIPS 2025 Climata Change AI Workshop in San Diego, USA</p></details> |
| **[TSGym: Design Choices for Deep Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17063v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, deep learning has driven significant advancements in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) tasks. However, much of the current research in MTSF tends to evaluate models from a holistic perspective, which obscures the individual contributions and leaves critical issues unaddressed. Adhering to the current modeling paradigms, this work bridges these gaps by systematically decomposing deep MTSF methods into their core, fine-grained components like series-patching tokenization, channel-independent strategy, attention modules, or even Large Language Models and Time-series Foundation Models. Through extensive experiments and component-level analysis, our work offers more profound insights than previous benchmarks that typically discuss models as a whole. Furthermore, we propose a novel automated solution called TSGym for MTSF tasks. Unlike traditional hyperparameter tuning, neural architecture searching or fixed model selection, TSGym performs fine-grained component selection and automated model construction, which enables the creation of more effective solutions tailored to diverse time series data, therefore enhancing model transferability across different data sources and robustness against distribution shifts. Extensive experiments indicate that TSGym significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art MTSF and AutoML methods.

Conventional methods such as RNNs and Transformers, while effective for discrete-time and regularly sampled data, face significant challenges in capturing the continuous dynamics and irregular sampling patterns inherent in real-world scenarios.

| **[Persistence Spheres: Bi-continuous Representations of Persistence Diagrams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16999v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce persistence spheres, a novel functional representation of persistence diagrams. Unlike existing embeddings (such as persistence images, landscapes, or kernel methods), persistence spheres provide a bi-continuous mapping: they are Lipschitz continuous with respect to the 1-Wasserstein distance and admit a continuous inverse on their image. This ensures, in a theoretically optimal way, both stability and geometric fidelity, making persistence spheres the representation that most closely mirrors the Wasserstein geometry of PDs in linear space. We derive explicit formulas for persistence spheres, showing that they can be computed efficiently and parallelized with minimal overhead. Empirically, we evaluate them on diverse regression and classification tasks involving functional data, time series, graphs, meshes, and point clouds. Across these benchmarks, persistence spheres consistently deliver state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to persistence images, persistence landscapes, and the sliced Wasserstein kernel.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Inductive Biases for fMRI Time Series Classification during Resting-state and Movie-watching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16973v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has advanced fMRI analysis, yet it remains unclear which architectural inductive biases are most effective at capturing functional patterns in human brain activity. This issue is particularly important in small-sample settings, as most datasets fall into this category. We compare models with three major inductive biases in deep learning including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformers for the task of biological sex classification. These models are evaluated within a unified pipeline using parcellated multivariate fMRI time series from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) 7-Tesla cohort, which includes four resting-state runs and four movie-watching task runs. We assess performance on Whole-brain, subcortex, and 12 functional networks. CNNs consistently achieved the highest discrimination for sex classification in both resting-state and movie-watching, while LSTM and Transformer models underperformed. Network-resolved analyses indicated that the Whole-brain, Default Mode, Cingulo-Opercular, Dorsal Attention, and Frontoparietal networks were the most discriminative. These results were largely similar between resting-state and movie-watching. Our findings indicate that, at this dataset size, discriminative information is carried by local spatial patterns and inter-regional dependencies, favoring convolutional inductive bias. Our study provides insights for selecting deep learning architectures for fMRI time series classification.</p></details> |  |

QASA constructs quantum queries/keys/values via variational quantum circuits (VQCs) and applies standard softmax attention over Pauli-$Z$ expectation vectors, yielding a drop-in attention module for financial time-series decision making. Using daily data for \textbf{BTCUSDC} over \textbf{Jan-2024--Jan-2025} with a 70/15/15 time-series split, we compare QASA against classical ensembles, a transformer, and pure quantum baselines under Return, Sharpe, and Max Drawdown. The \textbf{QASA-Sequence} variant attains the \emph{best single-model risk-adjusted performance} (\textbf{13.99\%} return; \textbf{Sharpe 1.76}), while hybrid models average \textbf{11.2\%} return (vs.\ 9.8\% classical; 4.4\% pure quantum), indicating a favorable performance--stability--cost trade-off.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches predominantly focus on model heterogeneity and aggregation techniques, largely overlooking the fundamental impact of dataset size characteristics on federated training dynamics. This paper introduces Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL), a novel progressive training framework that systematically organizes federated learning based on dataset size characteristics across heterogeneous multi-modal data. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation across 13 diverse datasets spanning 7 modalities (vision, text, time series, audio, sensor, medical vision, and multimodal) reveals critical insights: 1) an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500 samples for federated learning effectiveness; 2) a clear modality performance hierarchy with structured data (time series, sensor) significantly outperforming unstructured data (text, multimodal); and 3) systematic performance degradation for large datasets exceeding 2000 samples. SAFL achieves an average accuracy of 87.68% across all datasets, with structured data modalities reaching 99%+ accuracy. The framework demonstrates superior communication efficiency, reducing total data transfer to 7.38 GB across 558 communications while maintaining high performance. Our real-time monitoring framework provides unprecedented insights into system resource utilization, network efficiency, and training dynamics. This work fills critical gaps in understanding how data characteristics should drive federated learning strategies, providing both theoretical insights and practical guidance for real-world FL deployments in neural network and learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to some technical issues</p></details> |

Traditional imputation methods often fail to preserve these temporal dynamics, leading to biased estimates and reduced analytical integrity. In this study, we introduce and evaluate a structure-preserving imputation framework that incorporates significant periodic components into the multiple imputation process via the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB). We simulate time series data containing annual and monthly periodicities and introduce varying levels of noise representing low, moderate, and high signal-to-noise scenarios to mimic real world variability. Missing data are introduced under Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) mechanisms across a range of missingness proportions (5% - 70%). VBPBB is used to extract dominant periodic components at multiple frequencies, which are then bootstrapped and included as covariates in the Amelia II multiple imputation model. The performance of this periodicity-enhanced approach is compared against standard imputation methods that do not incorporate temporal structure. Our results demonstrate that the VBPBB-enhanced imputation framework consistently outperforms conventional approaches across all tested conditions, with the greatest performance gains observed in high-noise settings and when multiple periodic components are retained. This study addresses critical limitations in existing imputation techniques by offering a flexible, periodicity-aware solution that preserves temporal structure in incomplete time series. We further explore the methodological implications of incorporating frequency-based components and discuss future directions for advancing robust imputation in temporally correlated data environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figure and 3 tables</p></details> |

These factors introduce substantial variability and noise into outage data, making reliable prediction challenging. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), are particularly effective for modeling nonlinear and dynamic time-series data, with proven applications in stock price forecasting [2], energy demand prediction, demand response [3], and traffic flow management [4]. This paper introduces a hybrid deep learning framework, termed PCA-PR-Seq2Seq-Adam-LSTM, that integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Poisson Regression (PR), a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture, and an Adam-optimized LSTM. PCA is employed to reduce dimensionality and stabilize data variance, while Poisson Regression effectively models discrete outage events. The Seq2Seq-Adam-LSTM component enhances temporal feature learning through efficient gradient optimization and long-term dependency capture. The framework is evaluated using real-world outage records from Michigan, and results indicate that the proposed approach significantly improves forecasting accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, existing generalist time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10% and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks, establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.</p></details> | NeurIPS |

Surprisingly, even after fine-tuning, TSFMs cannot consistently outperform smaller, specialized models trained on full-shot downstream data. A key question is how to realize effective adaptation of TSFMs for a target forecasting task. Through empirical studies on various TSFMs, the pre-trained models often exhibit inherent sparsity and redundancy in computation, suggesting that TSFMs have learned to activate task-relevant network substructures to accommodate diverse forecasting tasks. To preserve this valuable prior knowledge, we propose a structured pruning method to regularize the subsequent fine-tuning process by focusing it on a more relevant and compact parameter space. Extensive experiments on seven TSFMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning a smaller, pruned TSFM significantly improves forecasting performance compared to fine-tuning original models. This prune-then-finetune paradigm often enables TSFMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance and surpass strong specialized baselines.

Trained on massive corpora of data, these models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in language understanding, generation, summarization, and reasoning, transforming how intelligent systems process and interact with human language. Although LLMs may still seem like a recent breakthrough, the field is already witnessing the rise of a new and more general category: multi-modal, multi-task foundation models (M3T FMs). These models go beyond language and can process heterogeneous data types/modalities, such as time-series measurements, audio, imagery, tabular records, and unstructured logs, while supporting a broad range of downstream tasks spanning forecasting, classification, control, and retrieval. When combined with federated learning (FL), they give rise to M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs): a highly recent and largely unexplored class of models that enable scalable, privacy-preserving model training/fine-tuning across distributed data sources. In this paper, we take one of the first steps toward introducing these models to the power systems research community by offering a bidirectional perspective: (i) M3T FedFMs for smart grids and (ii) smart grids for FedFMs. In the former, we explore how M3T FedFMs can enhance key grid functions, such as load/demand forecasting and fault detection, by learning from distributed, heterogeneous data available at the grid edge in a privacy-preserving manner. In the latter, we investigate how the constraints and structure of smart grids, spanning energy, communication, and regulatory dimensions, shape the design, training, and deployment of M3T FedFMs.</p></details> |  |

In particular, the proposed model demonstrates improved performance on Draw Clock and Spiral tasks. Additionally, cross-dataset and multi-dataset experiments were consistently able to achieve high F1 scores, up to 98 for PD detection, highlighting the potential of the proposed model to generalize over different forms of handwriting signals, and enhance the detection of motor deficits in ND.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP)</p></details> |
| **[Proactive Statistical Process Control Using AI: A Time Series Forecasting Approach for Semiconductor Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16431v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the manufacturing industry, it is very important to keep machines and processes running smoothly and without unexpected problems. One of the most common tools used to check if everything is working properly is called Statistical Process Control (SPC). Traditional SPC methods work by checking whether recent measurements are within acceptable limits. However, they only react after a problem has already occurred. This can lead to wasted materials, machine downtime, and increased costs. In this paper, we present a smarter way to use SPC. Instead of just reacting to issues after they happen, our system can predict future problems before they occur. We use a machine learning tool called Facebook Prophet, which is designed to work with time-series data (data that changes over time). Prophet looks at past data and forecasts what the next value will be. Then, we use SPC rules to decide if the predicted value is in a Safe zone (no problem), a Warning zone (needs attention), or a Critical zone (may require shutting down the process). We applied this system to real data from a semiconductor manufacturing company. One of the challenges with this data is that the measurements are not taken at regular time intervals. This makes it harder to predict future values accurately. Despite this, our model was able to make strong predictions and correctly classify the risk level of future measurements. The main benefit of our system is that it gives engineers and technicians a chance to act early - before something goes wrong. This helps reduce unexpected failures and improves the overall stability and reliability of the production process. By combining machine learning with traditional SPC, we make quality control more proactive, accurate, and useful for modern industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, no .bbl file needed because bibliography already in main.tex file</p></details> |

Current approaches often focus on isolated feature representations, limiting their ability to fully capture the intricate temporal dynamics necessary for robust domain adaptation. In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging multi-view contrastive learning to integrate temporal patterns, derivative-based dynamics, and frequency-domain features. Our method employs independent encoders and a hierarchical fusion mechanism to learn feature-invariant representations that are transferable across domains while preserving temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on diverse medical datasets, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electromyography (EMG) demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in transfer learning tasks. By advancing the robustness and generalizability of machine learning models, our framework offers a practical pathway for deploying reliable AI systems in diverse healthcare settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the sixth Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning (CHIL 2025), PMLR 287:502-526, 2025.

This paper presents MAESTRO (Multi-modal Adaptive Estimation for Temporal Respiratory Disease Outbreak), a novel, unified framework that synergistically integrates advanced spectro-temporal modeling with multi-modal data fusion, including surveillance, web search trends, and meteorological data. By adaptively weighting heterogeneous data sources and decomposing complex time series patterns, the model achieves robust and accurate forecasts. Evaluated on over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period), MAESTRO demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior model fit with an R-square of 0.956. Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of its multi-modal and spectro-temporal components. The modular and reproducible pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to other regions and pathogens, presenting a powerful tool for epidemiological forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixing properties of some Markov chains models in random environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16118v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov chains in random environments (MCREs) have recently attracted renewed interest, as these processes naturally arise in many applications, such as econometrics and machine learning. Although specific asymptotic results, such as the law of the large numbers and central limit theorems, have been obtained for some of these models, their annealed dependence properties, such as strong mixing properties, are not well understood in general. We derive strong mixing properties for a wide range of MCREs that satisfy some drift/small set conditions, with general assumptions on the corresponding stochastic parameters and the mixing properties of the environments. We then demonstrate the wide range of applications of our results in time series analysis and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, with fewer restrictions than those found in existing literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[KRED: Korea Research Economic Database for Macroeconomic Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16115v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce KRED (Korea Research Economic Database), a new FRED MD style macroeconomic dataset for South Korea. KRED is constructed by aggregating 88 key monthly time series from multiple official sources (e.g., Bank of Korea ECOS, Statistics Korea KOSIS) into a unified, publicly available database. The dataset is aligned with the FRED MD format, enabling standardized transformations and direct comparability; an Appendix maps each Korean series to its FRED MD counterpart. Using a balanced panel of 80 series from 2009 to 2024, we extract four principal components via PCA that explain approximately 40% of the total variance. These four factors have intuitive economic interpretations, capturing monetary conditions, labor market activity, real output, and housing demand, analogous to diffusion indexes summarizing broad economic movements. Notably, the factor based diffusion indexes derived from KRED clearly trace major macroeconomic fluctuations over the sample period such as the 2020 COVID 19 recession. Our results demonstrate that KRED's factor structure can effectively condense complex economic information into a few informative indexes, yielding new insights into South Korea's business cycles and co movements.</p></details> |  |

However, EO data quality is poor due to clouds and variable lighting conditions. To address this, practitioners typically use compositing, but this critically removes the temporal phenological signal. Moreover, supervised machine learning to map composited pixels to task-specific classes requires accurately labelled data that are rarely available. We present TESSERA, a pixel-oriented foundation model for EO time series that creates 128-dimensional latent embeddings requiring only a few labels for task-specific training to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse complex tasks. TESSERA uses two encoders that combine optical data with synthetic aperture radar backscatter coefficients at 10m resolution, creating embeddings fused with a multilayer perceptron to generate annual global embedding maps. TESSERA closely matches or outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models across five diverse downstream tasks. It is unprecedented in ease of use, scale, and accuracy: no other open foundation model provides precomputed outputs with global, annual coverage at 10m resolution.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Dual-Masked Autoencoder (DMAE), a novel masked time-series modeling framework for unsupervised MTS representation learning. DMAE formulates two complementary pretext tasks: (1) reconstructing masked values based on visible attributes, and (2) estimating latent representations of masked features, guided by a teacher encoder. To further improve representation quality, we introduce a feature-level alignment constraint that encourages the predicted latent representations to align with the teacher's outputs. By jointly optimizing these objectives, DMAE learns temporally coherent and semantically rich representations. Comprehensive evaluations across classification, regression, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves consistent and superior performance over competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDM 2025</p></details> |

| **[Highly Efficient Direct Analytics on Semantic-aware Time Series Data Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13246v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm to tackle the challenges of massive growing data traffic and sustainable data communication. It shifts the focus from data fidelity to goal-oriented or task-oriented semantic transmission. While deep learning-based methods are commonly used for semantic encoding and decoding, they struggle with the sequential nature of time series data and high computation cost, particularly in resource-constrained IoT environments. Data compression plays a crucial role in reducing transmission and storage costs, yet traditional data compression methods fall short of the demands of goal-oriented communication systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for direct analytics on time series data compressed by the SHRINK compression algorithm. Through experimentation using outlier detection as a case study, we show that our method outperforms baselines running on uncompressed data in multiple cases, with merely 1% difference in the worst case. Additionally, it achieves four times lower runtime on average and accesses approximately 10% of the data volume, which enables edge analytics with limited storage and computation power. These results demonstrate that our approach offers reliable, high-speed outlier detection analytics for diverse IoT applications while extracting semantics from time-series data, achieving high compression, and reducing data transmission.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of arXiv:2503.13246, with significant additional contributions</p></details> |

However, current forecasting solutions lack the temporal and spatial resolution required by system operators. In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon. The results are competitive with those achieved by a commercial numerical weather prediction service.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 17 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy</p></details> |
| **[Automating Versatile Time-Series Analysis with Tiny Transformers on Embedded FPGAs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17662v5)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have shown strong performance across diverse time-series tasks, but their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to high memory and computational demand. While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40. All source code will be released in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Edwina1030/TinyTransformer4TS).</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, accepted by IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[ThermalGuardian: Temperature-Aware Testing of Automotive Deep Learning Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15815v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models play a vital role in autonomous driving systems, supporting critical functions such as environmental perception. To accelerate model inference, these deep learning models' deployment relies on automotive deep learning frameworks, for example, PaddleInference in Apollo and TensorRT in AutoWare. However, unlike deploying deep learning models on the cloud, vehicular environments experience extreme ambient temperatures varying from -40{\deg}C to 50{\deg}C, significantly impacting GPU temperature. Additionally, heats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase. These temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments through mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks are designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency variations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer critical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors, high/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series operators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot be detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they ignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality. To bridge this gap, we propose ThermalGuardian, the first automotive deep learning framework testing method under temperature-varying environments. Specifically, ThermalGuardian generates test input models using model mutation rules targeting temperature-sensitive operators, simulates GPU temperature fluctuations based on Newton's law of cooling, and controls GPU frequency based on real-time GPU temperature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep learning based doubly robust test for Granger causality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15798v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Granger causality is popular for analyzing time series data in many applications from natural science to social science including genomics, neuroscience, economics, and finance. Consequently, the Granger causality test has become one of the main concerns of the econometrician for decades. Taking advantage of the theoretical breakthroughs in deep learning in recent years, we propose a doubly robust Granger causality test (DRGCT). Our method offers several key advantages. The first and most direct benefit is for the users, DRGCT allows them to handle large lag orders while alleviating the curse of dimensionality that traditional nonlinear Granger causality tests usually face. Second, introducing a doubly robust test statistic for time series based on neural networks that achieves a parametric convergence rate not only suggests a new paradigm for nonparametric inference in econometrics, but also broadens the application scope of deep learning. Third, a multiplier bootstrap method, combined with the doubly robust approach, provides an efficient way to obtain critical values, effectively reducing computational time and avoiding redundant calculations. We prove that the test asymptotically controls the type I error, while achieving power approaches one, and validate the effectiveness of our test through numerical simulations. In real data analysis, we apply DRGCT to revisit the price-volume relationship problem in the stock markets of America, China, and Japan.</p></details> |  |
| **[Channel-Imposed Fusion: A Simple yet Effective Method for Medical Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00337v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automatic classification of medical time series signals, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG), plays a pivotal role in clinical decision support and early detection of diseases. Although Transformer based models have achieved notable performance by implicitly modeling temporal dependencies through self-attention mechanisms, their inherently complex architectures and opaque reasoning processes undermine their trustworthiness in high stakes clinical settings. In response to these limitations, this study shifts focus toward a modeling paradigm that emphasizes structural transparency, aligning more closely with the intrinsic characteristics of medical data. We propose a novel method, Channel Imposed Fusion (CIF), which enhances the signal-to-noise ratio through cross-channel information fusion, effectively reduces redundancy, and improves classification performance. Furthermore, we integrate CIF with the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), known for its structural simplicity and controllable receptive field, to construct an efficient and explicit classification framework. Experimental results on multiple publicly available EEG and ECG datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of various classification metrics, but also significantly enhances the transparency of the classification process, offering a novel perspective for medical time series classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Temporal Dependencies within the Target for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04777v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a critical task across diverse domains. Despite significant advancements in LTSF research, we identify a performance bottleneck in existing LTSF methods caused by the inadequate modeling of Temporal Dependencies within the Target (TDT). To address this issue, we propose a novel and generic temporal modeling framework, Temporal Dependency Alignment (TDAlign), that equips existing LTSF methods with TDT learning capabilities. TDAlign introduces two key innovations: 1) a loss function that aligns the change values between adjacent time steps in the predictions with those in the target, ensuring consistency with variation patterns, and 2) an adaptive loss balancing strategy that seamlessly integrates the new loss function with existing LTSF methods without introducing additional learnable parameters. As a plug-and-play framework, TDAlign enhances existing methods with minimal computational overhead, featuring only linear time complexity and constant space complexity relative to the prediction length. Extensive experiments on six strong LTSF baselines across seven real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of TDAlign. On average, TDAlign reduces baseline prediction errors by \textbf{1.47\%} to \textbf{9.19\%} and change value errors by \textbf{4.57\%} to \textbf{15.78\%}, highlighting its substantial performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

The work used feature-rich synthetic dataset experiments in Docker, which acted like production environments that processed 100 to 500 records per batch and 6 to 12 requests per batch in parallel. Efforts have been concentrated in the areas of better query plans, cached execution plans, parallel processing, and resource management. The experimental results show that OpenMLDB can support approximately 12,500 QPS with less than 1 ms latency, outperforming SparkSQL and ClickHouse by a factor of 23 and PostgreSQL and MySQL by 3.57 times. This study assessed the impact of optimization and showed that query plan optimization accounted for 35% of the performance gains, caching for 25%, and parallel processing for 20%. These results illustrate OpenMLDB's capability for time-sensitive ML use cases, such as fraud detection, personalized recommendation, and time series forecasting. The system's modular optimization framework, which combines batch and stream processing without interference, contributes to its significant performance gain over traditional database systems, particularly in applications that require real-time feature computation and serving. This study contributes to the understanding and design of high-performance SQL+ML systems and highlights the need for specialized SQL optimization for ML workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 1 Table</p></details> |

Existing methods, including Transformer and MLP-based models, often struggle to capture these intertwined characteristics in a unified and structured manner. We propose the Dual Pyramid Attention Network (DPANet), a novel architecture that explicitly decouples and concurrently models temporal multi-scale dynamics and spectral multi-resolution periodicities. DPANet constructs two parallel pyramids: a Temporal Pyramid built on progressive downsampling, and a Frequency Pyramid built on band-pass filtering. The core of our model is the Cross-Pyramid Fusion Block, which facilitates deep, interactive information exchange between corresponding pyramid levels via cross-attention. This fusion proceeds in a coarse-to-fine hierarchy, enabling global context to guide local representation learning. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that DPANet achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming prior models. Code is available at https://github.com/hit636/DPANet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modelling time series of counts with hysteresis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15508v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we propose a novel model for time series of counts called the hysteretic Poisson autoregressive (HPART) model with thresholds by extending the linear Poisson autoregressive model into a nonlinear model. Unlike other approaches that bear the adjective ``hysteretic", our model incorporates a scientifically relevant controlling factor that produces genuine hysteresis. Further, we re-analyse the buffered Poisson autoregressive (BPART) model with thresholds. Although the two models share the convenient piecewise linear structure, the HPART model probes deeper into the intricate dynamics that governs regime switching. We study the maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of both models and their asymptotic properties in a unified manner, establish tests of separate families of hypotheses for the non-nested case involving a BPART model and a HPART model, and demonstrate the finite-sample efficacy of parameter estimation and tests with Monte Carlo simulation. We showcase advantages of the HPART model with two real time series, including plausible interpretations and improved out-of-sample predictions.</p></details> |  |

We present SolarCAST, a causally informed model predicting future global horizontal irradiance (GHI) at a target site using only historical GHI from site X and nearby stations S - unlike prior work that relies on sky-camera or satellite imagery requiring specialized hardware and heavy preprocessing. To deliver high accuracy with only public sensor data, SolarCAST models three classes of confounding factors behind X-S correlations using scalable neural components: (i) observable synchronous variables (e.g., time of day, station identity), handled via an embedding module; (ii) latent synchronous factors (e.g., regional weather patterns), captured by a spatio-temporal graph neural network; and (iii) time-lagged influences (e.g., cloud movement across stations), modeled with a gated transformer that learns temporal shifts. It outperforms leading time-series and multimodal baselines across diverse geographical conditions, and achieves a 25.9% error reduction over the top commercial forecaster, Solcast. SolarCAST offers a lightweight, practical, and generalizable solution for localized solar forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CIKM 2025</p></details> |

A crucial element of these models is positional encoding, which allows transformers to capture the intrinsic sequential nature of time series data. This survey systematically examines existing techniques for positional encoding in transformer-based time series models. We investigate a variety of methods, including fixed, learnable, relative, and hybrid approaches, and evaluate their effectiveness in different time series classification tasks. Our findings indicate that data characteristics like sequence length, signal complexity, and dimensionality significantly influence method effectiveness. Advanced positional encoding methods exhibit performance gains in terms of prediction accuracy, however, they come at the cost of increased computational complexity. Furthermore, we outline key challenges and suggest potential research directions to enhance positional encoding strategies. By delivering a comprehensive overview and quantitative benchmarking, this survey intends to assist researchers and practitioners in selecting and designing effective positional encoding methods for transformer-based time series models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context parroting: A simple but tough-to-beat baseline for foundation models in scientific machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11349v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent time-series foundation models exhibit strong abilities to predict physical systems. These abilities include zero-shot forecasting, in which a model forecasts future states of a system given only a short trajectory as context, without knowledge of the underlying physics. Here, we show that foundation models often forecast through a simple parroting strategy, and when they are not parroting they exhibit some shared failure modes such as converging to the mean. As a result, a naive context parroting model that copies directly from the context scores higher than leading time-series foundation models on predicting a diverse range of dynamical systems, including low-dimensional chaos, turbulence, coupled oscillators, and electrocardiograms -- and at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. We draw a parallel between context parroting and induction heads, which explains recent works showing that large language models can often be repurposed for time series forecasting. Our dynamical systems perspective also ties the scaling between forecast accuracy and context length to the fractal dimension of the underlying chaotic attractor, providing insight into previously observed in-context neural scaling laws. By revealing the performance gaps and failure modes of current time-series foundation models, context parroting can guide the design of future foundation models and help identify in-context learning strategies beyond parroting.</p></details> | <details><summary>New e...</summary><p>New experiments on SciML tasks and other improvements</p></details> |

This paper introduces SPH-Net (Stock Price Prediction Hybrid Neural Network), an innovative deep learning framework designed to enhance the accuracy of time series forecasting in financial markets. The proposed architecture employs a novel co-attention mechanism that initially processes temporal patterns through a Vision Transformer, followed by refined feature extraction via an attention mechanism, thereby capturing both global and local dependencies in market data. To rigorously evaluate the model's performance, we conduct comprehensive experiments on eight diverse stock datasets: AMD, Ebay, Facebook, FirstService Corp, Tesla, Google, Mondi ADR, and Matador Resources. Each dataset is standardized using six fundamental market indicators: Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume, representing a complete set of features for comprehensive market analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that SPH-Net consistently outperforms existing stock prediction models across all evaluation metrics. The model's superior performance stems from its ability to effectively capture complex temporal patterns while maintaining robustness against market noise. By significantly improving prediction accuracy in financial time series analysis, SPH-Net provides valuable decision-support capabilities for investors and financial analysts, potentially enabling more informed investment strategies and risk assessment in volatile market conditions.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a panel VAR model with a shared low-rank structure, modulated by subpopulation-specific weights, and complemented by idiosyncratic sparse components. To ensure parameter identifiability, we impose structural constraints that lead to a nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization problem. We develop a multi-block Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for parameter estimation and establish its convergence under mild regularity conditions. Furthermore, we derive consistency guarantees for the proposed estimators under high-dimensional scaling. The effectiveness of the proposed modeling framework and estimators is demonstrated through experiments on both synthetic data and a real-world neuroscience data set.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) is a powerful signal-processing method for periodicity-aware decomposition and has seen growing adoption in recent years. However, existing studies often suffer from information leakage and rely on inappropriate hyperparameter tuning. To address these issues, we propose VMDNet, a causality-preserving framework that (i) applies sample-wise VMD to avoid leakage; (ii) represents each decomposed mode with frequency-aware embeddings and decodes it using parallel temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), ensuring mode independence and efficient learning; and (iii) introduces a bilevel, Stackelberg-inspired optimisation to adaptively select VMD's two core hyperparameters: the number of modes (K) and the bandwidth penalty (alpha). Experiments on two energy-related datasets demonstrate that VMDNet achieves state-of-the-art results when periodicity is strong, showing clear advantages in capturing structured periodic patterns while remaining robust under weak periodicity.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, most studies do not address significant scientific applications. This paper aims to identify key features in time series by examining hydrology data. Our work advances computer science by emphasizing critical application features and contributes to hydrology and other scientific fields by identifying modeling approaches that effectively capture these features. Scientific time series data are inherently complex, involving observations from multiple locations, each with various time-dependent data streams and exogenous factors that may be static or time-varying and either application-dependent or purely mathematical. This research analyzes hydrology time series from the CAMELS and Caravan global datasets, which encompass rainfall and runoff data across catchments, featuring up to six observed streams and 209 static parameters across approximately 8,000 locations. Our investigation assesses the impact of exogenous data through eight different model configurations for key hydrology tasks. Results demonstrate that integrating exogenous information enhances data representation, reducing mean squared error by up to 40% in the largest dataset. Additionally, we present a detailed performance comparison of over 20 state-of-the-art pattern and foundation models. The analysis is fully open-source, facilitated by Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab for LSTM-based modeling, data preprocessing, and model comparisons. Preliminary findings using alternative deep learning architectures reveal that models incorporating comprehensive observed and exogenous data outperform more limited approaches, including foundation models. Notably, natural annual periodic exogenous time series contribute the most significant improvements, though static and other periodic factors are also valuable.</p></details> |  |

However, the application of health agents to fulfill the diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored. In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices and common personal health records, and provide personalized health recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate, personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent (PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10 benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible to everyone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor updates to the manuscript (V2)</p></details> |

However, directly applying these methods to data from forceful tool use tasks is challenging because streaming sensor data in the real world tends to be inherently noisy, exhibits non-stationary behavior, and varies across different tasks and tools. To address these challenges, we propose a method, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque features from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect anomalies. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods in terms of F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) on four forceful tool-use tasks, demonstrating that our method has better performance and is more robust to a noisy dataset. We also propose the method of parallel anomaly score evaluation based on one-step diffusion and demonstrate how our method can be used for online anomaly detection in several forceful tool use experiments.</p></details> |  |

Large pre-trained models such as Chronos and Time-MoE show strong zero-shot (ZS) performance but suffer from high computational costs. In this work, We introduce Super-Linear, a lightweight and scalable mixture-of-experts (MoE) model for general forecasting. It replaces deep architectures with simple frequency-specialized linear experts, trained on resampled data across multiple frequency regimes. A lightweight spectral gating mechanism dynamically selects relevant experts, enabling efficient, accurate forecasting. Despite its simplicity, Super-Linear matches state-of-the-art performance while offering superior efficiency, robustness to various sampling rates, and enhanced interpretability.

| **[Improving Internet Traffic Matrix Prediction via Time Series Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15072v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel framework that leverages time series clustering to improve internet traffic matrix (TM) prediction using deep learning (DL) models. Traffic flows within a TM often exhibit diverse temporal behaviors, which can hinder prediction accuracy when training a single model across all flows. To address this, we propose two clustering strategies, source clustering and histogram clustering, that group flows with similar temporal patterns prior to model training. Clustering creates more homogeneous data subsets, enabling models to capture underlying patterns more effectively and generalize better than global prediction approaches that fit a single model to the entire TM. Compared to existing TM prediction methods, our method reduces RMSE by up to 92\% for Abilene and 75\% for G\'EANT. In routing scenarios, our clustered predictions also reduce maximum link utilization (MLU) bias by 18\% and 21\%, respectively, demonstrating the practical benefits of clustering when TMs are used for network optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICMLA 2025</p></details> |
| **[From Patterns to Predictions: A Shapelet-Based Framework for Directional Forecasting in Noisy Financial Markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15040v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directional forecasting in financial markets requires both accuracy and interpretability. Before the advent of deep learning, interpretable approaches based on human-defined patterns were prevalent, but their structural vagueness and scale ambiguity hindered generalization. In contrast, deep learning models can effectively capture complex dynamics, yet often offer limited transparency. To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage framework that integrates unsupervised pattern extracion with interpretable forecasting. (i) SIMPC segments and clusters multivariate time series, extracting recurrent patterns that are invariant to amplitude scaling and temporal distortion, even under varying window sizes. (ii) JISC-Net is a shapelet-based classifier that uses the initial part of extracted patterns as input and forecasts subsequent partial sequences for short-term directional movement. Experiments on Bitcoin and three S&P 500 equities demonstrate that our method ranks first or second in 11 out of 12 metric--dataset combinations, consistently outperforming baselines. Unlike conventional deep learning models that output buy-or-sell signals without interpretable justification, our approach enables transparent decision-making by revealing the underlying pattern structures that drive predictive outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, accepted at ACM CIKM 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Marginals: Learning Joint Spatio-Temporal Patterns for Multivariate Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15033v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we aim to improve multivariate anomaly detection (AD) by modeling the \textit{time-varying non-linear spatio-temporal correlations} found in multivariate time series data . In multivariate time series data, an anomaly may be indicated by the simultaneous deviation of interrelated time series from their expected collective behavior, even when no individual time series exhibits a clearly abnormal pattern on its own. In many existing approaches, time series variables are assumed to be (conditionally) independent, which oversimplifies real-world interactions. Our approach addresses this by modeling joint dependencies in the latent space and decoupling the modeling of \textit{marginal distributions, temporal dynamics, and inter-variable dependencies}. We use a transformer encoder to capture temporal patterns, and to model spatial (inter-variable) dependencies, we fit a multi-variate likelihood and a copula. The temporal and the spatial components are trained jointly in a latent space using a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to learn meaningful feature representations to separate normal and anomaly samples.</p></details> |  |

We introduce warp quantification analysis (WQA), a framework that derives interpretable geometric and structural descriptors from DTW paths. Controlled simulations showed that each metric selectively tracked its intended driver with minimal crosstalk. Applied to large-scale fMRI, WQA revealed distinct network signatures and complementary associations with schizophrenia negative symptom severity, capturing clinically meaningful variability beyond DTW distance. WQA transforms DTW from a single-score method into a family of alignment descriptors, offering a principled and generalizable extension for richer characterization of temporal coupling across domains where nonlinear normalization is essential.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[DAG: A Dual Causal Network for Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14933v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is crucial in various fields such as economics, traffic, and AIOps. However, in real-world applications, focusing solely on the endogenous variables (i.e., target variables), is often insufficient to ensure accurate predictions. Considering exogenous variables (i.e., covariates) provides additional predictive information, thereby improving forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods for time series forecasting with exogenous variables (TSF-X) have the following shortcomings: 1) they do not leverage future exogenous variables, 2) they fail to account for the causal relationships between endogenous and exogenous variables. As a result, their performance is suboptimal. In this study, to better leverage exogenous variables, especially future exogenous variable, we propose a general framework DAG, which utilizes dual causal network along both the temporal and channel dimensions for time series forecasting with exogenous variables. Specifically, we first introduce the Temporal Causal Module, which includes a causal discovery module to capture how historical exogenous variables affect future exogenous variables. Following this, we construct a causal injection module that incorporates the discovered causal relationships into the process of forecasting future endogenous variables based on historical endogenous variables. Next, we propose the Channel Causal Module, which follows a similar design principle. It features a causal discovery module models how historical exogenous variables influence historical endogenous variables, and a causal injection module incorporates the discovered relationships to enhance the prediction of future endogenous variables based on future exogenous variables.</p></details> |  |

We propose Diffusion Scenario Tree (DST), a general framework for constructing scenario trees for multivariate prediction tasks using diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting models. DST recursively samples future trajectories and organizes them into a tree via clustering, ensuring non-anticipativity (decisions depending only on observed history) at each stage. We evaluate the framework on the optimization task of energy arbitrage in New York State's day-ahead electricity market. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms the same optimization algorithms that use scenario trees from more conventional models and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning baselines. Furthermore, using DST for stochastic optimization yields more efficient decision policies, achieving higher performance by better handling uncertainty than deterministic and stochastic MPC variants using the same diffusion-based forecaster.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, and 1 algorithm.

| **[Forecasting in small open emerging economies Evidence from Thailand](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14805v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting inflation in small open economies is difficult because limited time series and strong external exposures create an imbalance between few observations and many potential predictors. We study this challenge using Thailand as a representative case, combining more than 450 domestic and international indicators. We evaluate modern Bayesian shrinkage and factor models, including Horseshoe regressions, factor-augmented autoregressions, factor-augmented VARs, dynamic factor models, and Bayesian additive regression trees. Our results show that factor models dominate at short horizons, when global shocks and exchange rate movements drive inflation, while shrinkage-based regressions perform best at longer horizons. These models not only improve point and density forecasts but also enhance tail-risk performance at the one-year horizon. Shrinkage diagnostics, on the other hand, additionally reveal that Google Trends variables, especially those related to food essential goods and housing costs, progressively rotate into predictive importance as the horizon lengthens. This underscores their role as forward-looking indicators of household inflation expectations in small open economies.</p></details> |  |
| **[DualSG: A Dual-Stream Explicit Semantic-Guided Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21830v4)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications. Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively, methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs, rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation. Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025 (ACM MM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[DeCoP: Enhancing Self-Supervised Time Series Representation with Dependency Controlled Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14642v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling dynamic temporal dependencies is a critical challenge in time series pre-training, which evolve due to distribution shifts and multi-scale patterns. This temporal variability severely impairs the generalization of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Existing frameworks fail to capture the complex interactions of short- and long-term dependencies, making them susceptible to spurious correlations that degrade generalization. To address these limitations, we propose DeCoP, a Dependency Controlled Pre-training framework that explicitly models dynamic, multi-scale dependencies by simulating evolving inter-patch dependencies. At the input level, DeCoP introduces Instance-wise Patch Normalization (IPN) to mitigate distributional shifts while preserving the unique characteristics of each patch, creating a robust foundation for representation learning. At the latent level, a hierarchical Dependency Controlled Learning (DCL) strategy explicitly models inter-patch dependencies across multiple temporal scales, with an Instance-level Contrastive Module (ICM) enhances global generalization by learning instance-discriminative representations from time-invariant positive pairs. DeCoP achieves state-of-the-art results on ten datasets with lower computing resources, improving MSE by 3% on ETTh1 over PatchTST using only 37% of the FLOPs.</p></details> |  |

This limitation is particularly problematic for time series analysis, where signals exhibit complex, non-stationary dynamics across multiple temporal scales. We introduce Dynamic Wavelet Positional Encoding (DyWPE), a novel signal-aware framework that generates positional embeddings directly from input time series using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Comprehensive experiments in ten diverse time series datasets demonstrate that DyWPE consistently outperforms eight existing state-of-the-art positional encoding methods, achieving average relative improvements of 9.1\% compared to baseline sinusoidal absolute position encoding in biomedical signals, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[AR-KAN: Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02967v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional neural networks struggle to capture the spectral structure of complex signals. Fourier neural networks (FNNs) attempt to address this by embedding Fourier series components, yet many real-world signals are almost-periodic with non-commensurate frequencies, posing additional challenges. Building on prior work showing that ARIMA outperforms large language models (LLMs) for forecasting, we extend the comparison to neural predictors and find ARIMA still superior. We therefore propose the Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (AR-KAN), which integrates a pre-trained AR module for temporal memory with a KAN for nonlinear representation. The AR module preserves essential temporal features while reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that AR-KAN matches ARIMA on almost-periodic functions and achieves the best results on $72\%$ of Rdatasets series, with a clear advantage on data with periodic structure. These results highlight AR-KAN as a robust and effective framework for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identification and Estimation of Multi-order Tensor Factor Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13418v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework in high-dimensional factor models to simultaneously analyse multiple tensor time series, each with potentially different tensor orders and dimensionality. The connection between different tensor time series is through their global factors that are correlated to each other. A salient feature of our model is that when all tensor time series have the same order, it can be regarded as an extension of multilevel factor models from vectors to general tensors. Under very mild conditions, we separate the global and local components in the proposed model. Parameter estimation is thoroughly discussed, including a consistent factor number estimator. With strong correlation between global factors and noise allowed, we derive the rates of convergence of our estimators, which can be more superior than those of existing methods for multilevel factor models. We also develop estimators that are more computationally efficient, with rates of convergence spelt out. Extensive experiments are performed under various settings, corroborating with the pronounced theoretical results. As a real application example, we analyse a set of taxi data to study the traffic flow between Times Squares and its neighbouring areas.</p></details> | 45 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Nonlinear Causality in Time Series Networks: With Application to Motor Imagery vs Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10374v3)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal interactions in time series networks can be dynamic and nonlinear, making it difficult to identify them using conventional linear causality estimations. We propose a novel approach, called Threshold Autoregressive Modeling for Causality (TAR4C), a causality detection approach built on threshold autoregressive (TAR) models, where a potential driver (cause variable) acts both as a predictor and as a trigger (switching threshold) that governs which autoregressive process the target (effect variable) follows. Threshold nonlinearity is conceptualized here to determine causality. The flow of the target is forced to transition between regimes with distinct dynamics when the driver exceeds a data-driven threshold in the past. We propose a two-stage inference procedure: Stage 1 tests for threshold connectivity (TC); Stage 2, conditional on a detected threshold effect, estimates threshold Granger causality (TGC). TAR4C is applied to a multichannel EEG dataset collected from a motor imagery and execution experiment. Delay-dependent directional interactions are observed among channels across different sites of the EEG map. The real-world application demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed approach for determining nonlinear causal connectivity in complex time-series networks, such as brain circuitry. The proposed model-based methodology extends to other complex networks of time series.</p></details> |  |

However, forecasting future deformation from sparse Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series data remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework that transforms these sparse point measurements into a dense spatio-temporal tensor. This methodological shift allows, for the first time, the direct application of advanced computer vision architectures to this forecasting problem. We design and implement a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network and Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model, specifically engineered to simultaneously learn spatial patterns and temporal dependencies from the generated data tensor. The model's performance is benchmarked against powerful machine learning baselines, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and LASSO regression, using Sentinel-1 data from eastern Ireland. Results demonstrate that the proposed architecture provides significantly more accurate and spatially coherent forecasts, establishing a new performance benchmark for this task. Furthermore, an interpretability analysis reveals that baseline models often default to simplistic persistence patterns, highlighting the necessity of our integrated spatio-temporal approach to capture the complex dynamics of ground deformation. Our findings confirm the efficacy and potential of spatio-temporal deep learning for high-resolution deformation forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing</p></details> |

| **[SCoT: Straight Consistent Trajectory for Pre-Trained Diffusion Model Distillations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16972v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained diffusion models are commonly used to generate clean data (e.g., images) from random noises, effectively forming pairs of noises and corresponding clean images. Distillation on these pre-trained models can be viewed as the process of constructing advanced trajectories within the pair to accelerate sampling. For instance, consistency model distillation develops consistent projection functions to regulate trajectories, although sampling efficiency remains a concern. Rectified flow method enforces straight trajectories to enable faster sampling, yet relies on numerical ODE solvers, which may introduce approximation errors. In this work, we bridge the gap between the consistency model and the rectified flow method by proposing a Straight Consistent Trajectory~(SCoT) model. SCoT enjoys the benefits of both approaches for fast sampling, producing trajectories with consistent and straight properties simultaneously. These dual properties are strategically balanced by targeting two critical objectives: (1) regulating the gradient of SCoT's mapping to a constant, (2) ensuring trajectory consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SCoT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18386v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory anomaly detection is essential for identifying unusual and unexpected movement patterns in applications ranging from intelligent transportation systems to urban safety and fraud prevention. Existing methods only consider limited aspects of the trajectory nature and its movement space by treating trajectories as sequences of sampled locations, with sampling determined by positioning technology, e.g., GPS, or by high-level abstractions such as staypoints. Trajectories are analyzed in Euclidean space, neglecting the constraints and connectivity information of the underlying movement network, e.g., road or transit networks. The proposed Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection (GETAD) framework tightly integrates road network topology, segment semantics, and historical travel patterns to model trajectory data. GETAD uses a Graph Attention Network to learn road-aware embeddings that capture both physical attributes and transition behavior, and augments these with graph-based positional encodings that reflect the spatial layout of the road network. A Transformer-based decoder models sequential movement, while a multiobjective loss function combining autoregressive prediction and supervised link prediction ensures realistic and structurally coherent representations. To improve the robustness of anomaly detection, we introduce Confidence Weighted Negative Log Likelihood (CW NLL), an anomaly scoring function that emphasizes high-confidence deviations. Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GETAD achieves consistent improvements over existing methods, particularly in detecting subtle anomalies in road-constrained environments. These results highlight the benefits of incorporating graph structure and contextual semantics into trajectory modeling, enabling more precise and context-aware anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACTIVE: Continuous Similarity Search for Vessel Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01142v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Publicly available vessel trajectory data is emitted continuously from the global AIS system. Continuous trajectory similarity search on this data has applications in, e.g., maritime navigation and safety. Existing proposals typically assume an offline setting and focus on finding similarities between complete trajectories. Such proposals are less effective when applied to online scenarios, where similarity comparisons must be performed continuously as new trajectory data arrives and trajectories evolve. We therefore propose a real-time continuous trajectory similarity search method for vessels (ACTIVE). We introduce a novel similarity measure, object-trajectory real-time distance, that emphasizes the anticipated future movement trends of vessels, enabling more predictive and forward-looking comparisons. Next, we propose a segment-based vessel trajectory index structure that organizes historical trajectories into smaller and manageable segments, facilitating accelerated similarity computations. Leveraging this index, we propose an efficient continuous similar trajectory search (CSTS) algorithm together with a variety of search space pruning strategies that reduce unnecessary computations during the continuous similarity search, thereby further improving efficiency. Extensive experiments on two large real-world AIS datasets offer evidence that ACTIVE is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods considerably. ACTIVE significantly reduces index construction costs and index size while achieving a 70% reduction in terms of query time and a 60% increase in terms of hit rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equality Constrained Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01939v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent success of diffusion-based generative models in image and natural language processing has ignited interest in diffusion-based trajectory optimization for nonlinear control systems. Existing methods cannot, however, handle the nonlinear equality constraints necessary for direct trajectory optimization. As a result, diffusion-based trajectory optimizers are currently limited to shooting methods, where the nonlinear dynamics are enforced by forward rollouts. This precludes many of the benefits enjoyed by direct methods, including flexible state constraints, reduced numerical sensitivity, and easy initial guess specification. In this paper, we present a method for diffusion-based optimization with equality constraints. This allows us to perform direct trajectory optimization, enforcing dynamic feasibility with constraints rather than rollouts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based optimization algorithm that supports the general nonlinear equality constraints required for direct trajectory optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACC 2...</summary><p>ACC 2025, fixed typo in equations (11)-(12)</p></details> |
| **[SocialTraj: Two-Stage Socially-Aware Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving via Conditional Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17850v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles (SVs) is crucial for autonomous driving systems to avoid misguided decisions and potential accidents. However, achieving reliable predictions in highly dynamic and complex traffic scenarios remains a significant challenge. One of the key impediments lies in the limited effectiveness of current approaches to capture the multi-modal behaviors of drivers, which leads to predicted trajectories that deviate from actual future motions. To address this issue, we propose SocialTraj, a novel trajectory prediction framework integrating social psychology principles through social value orientation (SVO). By utilizing Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to estimate the SVO of SVs, we obtain the critical social context to infer the future interaction trend. To ensure modal consistency in predicted behaviors, the estimated SVOs of SVs are embedded into a conditional denoising diffusion model that aligns generated trajectories with historical driving styles. Additionally, the planned future trajectory of the ego vehicle (EV) is explicitly incorporated to enhance interaction modeling. Extensive experiments on NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate that SocialTraj is capable of adapting to highly dynamic and interactive scenarios while generating socially compliant and behaviorally consistent trajectory predictions, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that dynamic SVO estimation and explicit ego-planning components notably improve prediction accuracy and substantially reduce inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Precision and High-Efficiency Trajectory Tracking for Excavators Based on Closed-Loop Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17387v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The complex nonlinear dynamics of hydraulic excavators, such as time delays and control coupling, pose significant challenges to achieving high-precision trajectory tracking. Traditional control methods often fall short in such applications due to their inability to effectively handle these nonlinearities, while commonly used learning-based methods require extensive interactions with the environment, leading to inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce EfficientTrack, a trajectory tracking method that integrates model-based learning to manage nonlinear dynamics and leverages closed-loop dynamics to improve learning efficiency, ultimately minimizing tracking errors. We validate our method through comprehensive experiments both in simulation and on a real-world excavator. Comparative experiments in simulation demonstrate that our method outperforms existing learning-based approaches, achieving the highest tracking precision and smoothness with the fewest interactions. Real-world experiments further show that our method remains effective under load conditions and possesses the ability for continual learning, highlighting its practical applicability.

Existing motion planning methods often require additional computational effort to generate the final trajectory by solving kinematic or dynamic equations. This paper highlights the strong potential of model-free reinforcement learning methods over model-based approaches for obstacle-free trajectory planning in joint space. We propose a fast trajectory planning system for manipulators that combines vision-based path planning in task space with reinforcement learning-based obstacle avoidance in joint space. We divide the framework into two key components. The first introduces an innovative vision-based trajectory planner in task space, leveraging the large-scale fast segment anything (FSA) model in conjunction with basis spline (B-spline)-optimized kinodynamic path searching. The second component enhances the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm by integrating action ensembles (AE) and policy feedback (PF), which greatly improve precision and stability in goal-reaching and obstacle avoidance within the joint space. These PPO enhancements increase the algorithm's adaptability across diverse robotic tasks, ensuring consistent execution of commands from the first component by the manipulator, while also enhancing both obstacle avoidance efficiency and reaching accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PPO enhancements, as well as simulation-to-simulation (Sim-to-Sim) and simulation-to-reality (Sim-to-Real) transfer, in improving model robustness and planner efficiency in complex scenarios. These enhancements allow the robot to perform obstacle avoidance and real-time trajectory planning in obstructed environments.

Recent model merging-based methods have attracted significant attention, but they still struggle to effectively manage the trade-off between learning new knowledge and preventing forgetting, a challenge largely stemming from suboptimal number of merges and merging frequency. In this paper, we introduce Adaptive Iterative Model Merging (AimMerging), a novel CL framework that utilizes learning and forgetting signals from the training trajectory to dynamically monitor the model's training status. Guided by dynamic monitoring, the training trajectory-guided merge controller adaptively determines the timing and frequency of iterative fusion, while the rehearsal-based knowledge fusion module computes the merging weights and executes the fusion. Comprehensive experiments on three CL benchmarks with various model sizes (from 770M to 13B) demonstrate that AimMerging achieves significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods, with an average relative improvement of 80% and 59% on FWT and BWT, respectively.

By employing a mix of heterogeneous time-to-go formulations leading to a cooperative guidance strategy, the swarm of vehicles is able to generate diverse trajectory families. This diversity expands the feasible solution space for simultaneous target interception, enhances robustness under disturbances, and enables flexible time-to-go adjustments without predictable detouring. From an adversarial perspective, heterogeneity obscures the collective interception intent by preventing straightforward prediction of swarm dynamics, effectively acting as an encryption layer in the trajectory domain. Simulations demonstrate that the swarm of heterogeneous vehicles is able to intercept a moving target simultaneously from a diverse set of initial engagement configurations.</p></details> |  |

Conventional mapping-planning-control pipelines incur high computational cost and propagate estimation errors. We present AERO-MPPI, a fully GPU-accelerated framework that unifies perception and planning through an anchor-guided ensemble of Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) optimizers. Specifically, we design a multi-resolution LiDAR point-cloud representation that rapidly extracts spatially distributed "anchors" as look-ahead intermediate endpoints, from which we construct polynomial trajectory guides to explore distinct homotopy path classes. At each planning step, we run multiple MPPI instances in parallel and evaluate them with a two-stage multi-objective cost that balances collision avoidance and goal reaching. Implemented entirely with NVIDIA Warp GPU kernels, AERO-MPPI achieves real-time onboard operation and mitigates the local-minima failures of single-MPPI approaches. Extensive simulations in forests, verticals, and inclines demonstrate sustained reliable flight above 7 m/s, with success rates above 80% and smoother trajectories compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Real-world experiments on a LiDAR-equipped quadrotor with NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX 16G confirm that AERO-MPPI runs in real time onboard and consistently achieves safe, agile, and robust flight in complex cluttered environments. The code will be open-sourced upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[DepTR-MOT: Unveiling the Potential of Depth-Informed Trajectory Refinement for Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17323v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a crucial component of robotic perception, yet existing Tracking-By-Detection (TBD) methods often rely on 2D cues, such as bounding boxes and motion modeling, which struggle under occlusions and close-proximity interactions. Trackers relying on these 2D cues are particularly unreliable in robotic environments, where dense targets and frequent occlusions are common. While depth information has the potential to alleviate these issues, most existing MOT datasets lack depth annotations, leading to its underexploited role in the domain. To unveil the potential of depth-informed trajectory refinement, we introduce DepTR-MOT, a DETR-based detector enhanced with instance-level depth information. Specifically, we propose two key innovations: (i) foundation model-based instance-level soft depth label supervision, which refines depth prediction, and (ii) the distillation of dense depth maps to maintain global depth consistency. These strategies enable DepTR-MOT to output instance-level depth during inference, without requiring foundation models and without additional computational cost. By incorporating depth cues, our method enhances the robustness of the TBD paradigm, effectively resolving occlusion and close-proximity challenges. Experiments on both the QuadTrack and DanceTrack datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving HOTA scores of 27.59 and 44.47, respectively. In particular, results on QuadTrack, a robotic platform MOT dataset, highlight the advantages of our method in handling occlusion and close-proximity challenges in robotic tracking.

Recent methods use diffusion on either graph embeddings or the discrete space of nodes and edges. However, simple changes to embeddings (say, adding noise) can mean uninterpretable changes in the graph. In discrete-space diffusion, each step may add or remove many nodes/edges. It is hard to predict what graph patterns we will observe after many diffusion steps. Our proposed method, called GraphWeave, takes a different approach. We separate pattern generation and graph construction. To find patterns in the training graphs, we see how they transform vectors during random walks. We then generate new graphs in two steps. First, we generate realistic random walk "trajectories" which match the learned patterns. Then, we find the optimal graph that fits these trajectories. The optimization infers all edges jointly, which improves robustness to errors. On four simulated and five real-world benchmark datasets, GraphWeave outperforms existing methods. The most significant differences are on large-scale graph structures such as PageRank, cuts, communities, degree distributions, and flows. GraphWeave is also 10x faster than its closest competitor. Finally, GraphWeave is simple, needing only a transformer and standard optimizers.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Adaptive Lyapunov-constrained MPC for fault-tolerant AUV trajectory tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17237v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are subject to various sources of faults during their missions, which challenges AUV control and operation in real environments. This paper addresses fault-tolerant trajectory tracking of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under thruster failures. We propose an adaptive Lyapunov-constrained model predictive control (LMPC) that guarantees stable trajectory tracking when the AUV switches between fault and normal modes. Particularly, we model different AUV thruster faults and build online failure identification based on Bayesian approach. This facilitates a soft switch between AUV status, and the identified and updated AUV failure model feeds LMPC controller for the control law derivation. The Lyapunov constrain in LMPC ensures that the trajectory tracking control remains stable during AUV status shifts, thus mitigating severe and fatal fluctuations when an AUV thruster occurs or recovers. We conduct numerical simulations on a four-thruster planar AUV using the proposed approach. The results demonstrate smooth transitions between thruster failure types and low trajectory tracking errors compared with the benchmark adaptive MPC and backstepping control with rapid failure identification and failure accommodation during the trajectory tracking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intention-aware Hierarchical Diffusion Model for Long-term Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17068v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term trajectory anomaly detection is a challenging problem due to the diversity and complex spatiotemporal dependencies in trajectory data. Existing trajectory anomaly detection methods fail to simultaneously consider both the high-level intentions of agents as well as the low-level details of the agent's navigation when analysing an agent's trajectories. This limits their ability to capture the full diversity of normal trajectories. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised trajectory anomaly detection method named Intention-aware Hierarchical Diffusion model (IHiD), which detects anomalies through both high-level intent evaluation and low-level sub-trajectory analysis. Our approach leverages Inverse Q Learning as the high-level model to assess whether a selected subgoal aligns with an agent's intention based on predicted Q-values. Meanwhile, a diffusion model serves as the low-level model to generate sub-trajectories conditioned on subgoal information, with anomaly detection based on reconstruction error. By integrating both models, IHiD effectively utilises subgoal transition knowledge and is designed to capture the diverse distribution of normal trajectories. Our experiments show that the proposed method IHiD achieves up to 30.2% improvement in anomaly detection performance in terms of F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we present a diffusion-based trajectory planning framework that is both rapid and safe. First, we introduce a scene-agnostic, MPC-based data generation pipeline that efficiently produces large volumes of kinematically feasible trajectories. Building on this dataset, our integrated diffusion planner maps raw onboard sensor inputs directly to kinematically feasible trajectories, enabling efficient inference while maintaining strong collision avoidance. To generalize to diverse, previously unseen scenarios, we compose diffusion models at test time, enabling safe behavior without additional training. We further propose a lightweight, rule-based safety filter that, from the candidate set, selects the trajectory meeting safety and kinematic-feasibility requirements. Across seen and unseen settings, the proposed method delivers real-time-capable inference with high safety and stability. Experiments on an F1TENTH vehicle demonstrate practicality on real hardware.

To guarantee safety and prevent collisions, autonomous vehicles must be capable of accurately predicting the trajectories of surrounding traffic agents. Over the past decade, significant efforts from both academia and industry have been dedicated to designing solutions for precise trajectory forecasting. These efforts have produced a diverse range of approaches, raising questions about the differences between these methods and whether trajectory prediction challenges have been fully addressed. This paper reviews a substantial portion of recent trajectory prediction methods proposing a taxonomy to classify existing solutions. A general overview of the prediction pipeline is also provided, covering input and output modalities, modeling features, and prediction paradigms existing in the literature. In addition, the paper discusses active research areas within trajectory prediction, addresses the posed research questions, and highlights the remaining research gaps and challenges.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{SMART} (Sycophancy Mitigation through Adaptive Reasoning Trajectories), which reframes sycophancy as a \textit{reasoning optimization problem} rather than an output alignment issue. SMART is a two-stage framework comprising: (1) Uncertainty-Aware Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree Search (UA-MCTS), which dynamically adjusts model exploration based on state-level uncertainty to collect high-quality, diverse reasoning trajectories alongside both stepwise progress and final outcome rewards; and (2) progress-based reinforcement learning, which fine-tunes the model using the collected trajectories and reward signals to reinforce effective reasoning patterns. Through extensive experiments, we show that SMART significantly reduces sycophantic behavior while preserving strong performance on out-of-distribution inputs and maintaining general capabilities. These results underscore the importance of optimizing internal reasoning mechanisms to build more truthful and aligned AI assistants.</p></details> |  |

The main limitation of previous drone cinematography workflows is that they require manual selection of waypoints and view angles based on predefined human intent, which is labor-intensive and yields inconsistent performance. In this paper, we propose employing large language models (LLMs) and vision foundation models (VFMs) to convert free-form natural language prompts directly into executable indoor UAV video tours. Specifically, our method comprises a vision-language retrieval pipeline for initial waypoint selection, a preference-based Bayesian optimization framework that refines poses using aesthetic feedback, and a motion planner that generates safe quadrotor trajectories. We validate ACDC through both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating that it robustly produces professional-quality footage across diverse indoor scenes without requiring expertise in robotics or cinematography. These results highlight the potential of embodied AI agents to close the loop from open-vocabulary dialogue to real-world autonomous aerial cinematography.</p></details> |  |

Existing unified frameworks often fail to capture these structured distributional shifts, resulting in suboptimal generalization across roles and domains. We propose AdaSports-Traj, an adaptive trajectory modeling framework that explicitly addresses both intra-domain and inter-domain distribution discrepancies in sports. At its core, AdaSports-Traj incorporates a Role- and Domain-Aware Adapter to conditionally adjust latent representations based on agent identity and domain context. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Contrastive Learning objective, which separately supervises role-sensitive and domain-aware representations to encourage disentangled latent structures without introducing optimization conflict. Experiments on three diverse sports datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptive design, achieving strong performance in both unified and cross-domain trajectory prediction settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDM 2025</p></details> |

It is well known that the effectiveness of such methods depends crucially on the relative correlations and computational costs of the available computational models. However, the question of how to automatically tune low-fidelity models to maximize performance remains an open area of research. This work investigates automated model tuning, which optimizes model hyperparameters to minimize estimator variance within a target computational budget. Focusing on multifidelity trajectory simulation estimators, the cost-versus-precision tradeoff enabled by this approach is demonstrated in a practical, online setting where upfront tuning costs cannot be amortized. Using a real-world entry, descent, and landing example, it is shown that automated model tuning largely outperforms hand-tuned models even when the overall computational budget is relatively low. Furthermore, for scenarios where the computational budget is large, model tuning solutions can approach the best-case multifidelity estimator performance where optimal model hyperparameters are known a priori. Recommendations for applying model tuning in practice are provided and avenues for enabling adoption of such approaches for budget-constrained problems are highlighted.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages with 15 figures in main text</p></details> |

The framework encodes states, actions, rewards, and transitions entirely within the quantum domain, enabling parallel exploration of state-action sequences through superposition and eliminating classical subroutines. Dynamic circuit operations, including mid-circuit measurement and reset, allow reuse of the same physical qubits across multiple agent-environment interactions, reducing qubit requirements from 7*T to 7 for T time steps while preserving logical continuity. Quantum arithmetic computes trajectory returns, and Grover's search is applied to the superposition of these evaluated trajectories to amplify the probability of measuring those with the highest return, thereby accelerating the identification of the optimal policy. Simulations demonstrate that the dynamic-circuit-based implementation preserves trajectory fidelity while reducing qubit usage by 66 percent relative to the static design. Experimental deployment on IBM Heron-class quantum hardware confirms that the framework operates within the constraints of current quantum processors and validates the feasibility of fully quantum multi-step reinforcement learning under noisy intermediate-scale quantum conditions. This framework advances the scalability and practical application of quantum reinforcement learning for large-scale sequential decision-making tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the instability of single-vehicle perception introduces certain limitations to trajectory prediction. In this paper, a novel lightweight framework for cooperative trajectory prediction, CoPAD, is proposed. This framework incorporates a fusion module based on the Hungarian algorithm and Kalman filtering, along with the Past Time Attention (PTA) module, mode attention module and anchor-oriented decoder (AoD). It effectively performs early fusion on multi-source trajectory data from vehicles and road infrastructure, enabling the trajectories with high completeness and accuracy. The PTA module can efficiently capture potential interaction information among historical trajectories, and the mode attention module is proposed to enrich the diversity of predictions. Additionally, the decoder based on sparse anchors is designed to generate the final complete trajectories. Extensive experiments show that CoPAD achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the DAIR-V2X-Seq dataset, validating the effectiveness of the model in cooperative trajectory prediction in V2X scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 pages, IROS2025</p></details> |
| **[SMART: Scalable Multi-Agent Reasoning and Trajectory Planning in Dense Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15737v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-vehicle trajectory planning is a non-convex problem that becomes increasingly difficult in dense environments due to the rapid growth of collision constraints. Efficient exploration of feasible behaviors and resolution of tight interactions are essential for real-time, large-scale coordination. This paper introduces SMART, Scalable Multi-Agent Reasoning and Trajectory Planning, a hierarchical framework that combines priority-based search with distributed optimization to achieve efficient and feasible multi-vehicle planning. The upper layer explores diverse interaction modes using reinforcement learning-based priority estimation and large-step hybrid A* search, while the lower layer refines solutions via parallelizable convex optimization. By partitioning space among neighboring vehicles and constructing robust feasible corridors, the method decouples the joint non-convex problem into convex subproblems solved efficiently in parallel. This design alleviates the step-size trade-off while ensuring kinematic feasibility and collision avoidance. Experiments show that SMART consistently outperforms baselines. On 50 m x 50 m maps, it sustains over 90% success within 1 s up to 25 vehicles, while baselines often drop below 50%. On 100 m x 100 m maps, SMART achieves above 95% success up to 50 vehicles and remains feasible up to 90 vehicles, with runtimes more than an order of magnitude faster than optimization-only approaches. Built on vehicle-to-everything communication, SMART incorporates vehicle-infrastructure cooperation through roadside sensing and agent coordination, improving scalability and safety. Real-world experiments further validate this design, achieving planning times as low as 0.014 s while preserving cooperative behaviors.</p></details> |  |

However, its effectiveness is often limited by two critical challenges: the reliance on extensive human input and the inherent difficulties in resolving query ambiguity and credit assignment during reward learning. In this paper, we introduce PRIMT, a PbRL framework designed to overcome these challenges by leveraging foundation models (FMs) for multimodal synthetic feedback and trajectory synthesis. Unlike prior approaches that rely on single-modality FM evaluations, PRIMT employs a hierarchical neuro-symbolic fusion strategy, integrating the complementary strengths of large language models and vision-language models in evaluating robot behaviors for more reliable and comprehensive feedback. PRIMT also incorporates foresight trajectory generation, which reduces early-stage query ambiguity by warm-starting the trajectory buffer with bootstrapped samples, and hindsight trajectory augmentation, which enables counterfactual reasoning with a causal auxiliary loss to improve credit assignment. We evaluate PRIMT on 2 locomotion and 6 manipulation tasks on various benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance over FM-based and scripted baselines.</p></details> |  |

In the first stage, heuristic trajectory sampling cluster (HTSC) is generated in the Frenet coordinate system using third-order interpolation with fifth-order polynomials and momentum-constrained trajectory optimization (MTO) constraints to ensure smoothness and feasibility. After first stage cost evaluation, the second stage leverages a residual-enhanced actor-critic network with LSTM-based temporal feature modeling to adaptively refine trajectory selection in the Cartesian coordinate system. A dual-stage cost modeling mechanism (DCMM) with weight transfer aligns semantic priorities across stages, supporting human-centered optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-ResB-PPO achieves significantly faster convergence, attaining stable policy performance in approximately half the training iterations required by the PPO baseline, while simultaneously enhancing both reward outcomes and training stability. Compared to baseline method, the selected model reduces average cost and cost variance by 30.3% and 53.3%, and lowers ego and obstacle risks by over 77%. These findings validate the framework's effectiveness in enhancing robustness, safety, and real-time feasibility in complex assistive planning tasks.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Movable-Antenna Trajectory Optimization for Wireless Sensing: CRB Scaling Laws over Time and Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14905v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a new wireless sensing system utilizing a movable antenna (MA) that continuously moves and receives sensing signals to enhance sensing performance over the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) sensing. We show that the angle estimation performance is fundamentally determined by the MA trajectory, and derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the mean square error (MSE) for angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation as a function of the trajectory for both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) antenna movement. For the 1D case, a globally optimal trajectory that minimizes the CRB is derived in closed form. Notably, the resulting CRB decreases cubically with sensing time in the time-constrained regime, whereas it decreases linearly with sensing time and quadratically with the movement line segment's length in the space-constrained regime. For the 2D case, we aim to achieve the minimum of maximum (min-max) CRBs of estimation MSE for the two AoAs with respect to the horizontal and vertical axes. To this end, we design an efficient alternating optimization algorithm that iteratively updates the MA's horizontal or vertical coordinates with the other being fixed, yielding a locally optimal trajectory. Numerical results show that the proposed 1D/2D MA-based sensing schemes significantly reduce both the CRB and actual AoA estimation MSE compared to conventional FPA-based sensing with uniform linear/planar arrays (ULAs/UPAs) as well as various benchmark MA trajectories. Moreover, it is revealed that the steering vectors of our designed 1D/2D MA trajectories have low correlation in the angular domain, thereby effectively increasing the angular resolution for achieving higher AoA estimation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages Koopman operator theory, which enables a linear representation of nonlinear dynamics by lifting trajectories into a higher-dimensional space. The framework follows a two-stage design: first, a probabilistic neural goal estimator predicts plausible long-term targets, specifying where to go; second, a Koopman operator-based refinement module incorporates intention and history into a nonlinear feature space, enabling linear prediction that dictates how to go. This dual structure not only ensures strong predictive accuracy but also inherits the favorable properties of linear operators while faithfully capturing nonlinear dynamics. As a result, our model offers three key advantages: (i) competitive accuracy, (ii) interpretability grounded in Koopman spectral theory, and (iii) low-latency deployment. We validate these benefits on ETH/UCY, the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, and nuScenes, which feature rich multi-agent interactions and map-constrained nonlinear motion. Across benchmarks, KoopCast consistently delivers high predictive accuracy together with mode-level interpretability and practical efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Universal Birkhoff Theory for Fast Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01400v3)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the last two decades, pseudospectral methods based on Lagrange interpolants have flourished in solving trajectory optimization problems and their flight implementations. In a seemingly unjustified departure from these highly successful methods, a new starting point for trajectory optimization is proposed. This starting point is based on the recently-developed concept of universal Birkhoff interpolants. The new approach offers a substantial computational upgrade to the Lagrange theory in completely flattening the rapid growth of the condition numbers from O(N2) to O(1), where N is the number of grid points. In addition, the Birkhoff-specific primal-dual computations are isolated to a well-conditioned linear system even for nonlinear, nonconvex problems. This is part I of a two-part paper. In part I, a new theory is developed on the basis of two hypotheses. Other than these hypotheses, the theoretical development makes no assumptions on the choices of basis functions or the selection of grid points. Several covector mapping theorems are proved to establish the mathematical equivalence between direct and indirect Birkhoff methods. In part II of this paper (with Proulx), it is shown that a select family of Gegenbauer grids satisfy the two hypotheses required for the theory to hold. Numerical examples in part II illustrate the power and utility of the new theory.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free observational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight objects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera coverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised trajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable prediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present advancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the noise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data. Building on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight Trajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending its applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual reality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera calibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of visual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an unsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory denoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines. Additionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such as Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task, providing a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative to integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor trajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances.

However, the secure offloading is an important issue when occurring aerial eavesdropping. Besides, the potential uncertainties in practical applications and flexible trajectory optimizations of UAVs pose formidable challenges for realizing robust offloading. In this paper, we consider the aerial secure MEC network including ground users, service unmanned aerial vehicles (S-UAVs) integrated with edge servers, and malicious UAVs overhearing transmission links. To deal with the task computation complexities, which are characterized as uncertainties, a robust problem is formulated with chance constraints. The energy cost is minimized by optimizing the connections, trajectories of S-UAVs and offloading ratios. Then, the proposed non-linear problem is tackled via the distributionally robust optimization and conditional value-at-risk mechanism, which is further transformed into the second order cone programming forms. Moreover, we decouple the reformulated problem and design the successive convex approximation for S-UAV trajectories. The global algorithm is designed to solve the sub-problems in a block coordinate decent manner. Finally, extensive simulations and numerical analyses are conducted to verify the robustness of the proposed algorithms, with just 2\% more energy cost compared with the ideal circumstance.</p></details> |  |

This is challenging since the progression of disease and response to treatment vary substantially across patients. Here, we propose to learn a representation of the early dynamics of treatment response from imaging data to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The longitudinal change in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of the breast forms trajectories in the latent space, serving as basis for prediction of successful response. The multi-task model represents appearance, fosters temporal continuity and accounts for the comparably high heterogeneity in the non-responder cohort.In experiments on the publicly available ISPY-2 dataset, a linear classifier in the latent trajectory space achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.761 using only pre-treatment data (T0), 0.811 using early response (T0 + T1), and 0.861 using four imaging time points (T0 -> T3). The code will be made available upon paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[STEP: Structured Training and Evaluation Platform for benchmarking trajectory prediction models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14801v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While trajectory prediction plays a critical role in enabling safe and effective path-planning in automated vehicles, standardized practices for evaluating such models remain underdeveloped. Recent efforts have aimed to unify dataset formats and model interfaces for easier comparisons, yet existing frameworks often fall short in supporting heterogeneous traffic scenarios, joint prediction models, or user documentation. In this work, we introduce STEP -- a new benchmarking framework that addresses these limitations by providing a unified interface for multiple datasets, enforcing consistent training and evaluation conditions, and supporting a wide range of prediction models. We demonstrate the capabilities of STEP in a number of experiments which reveal 1) the limitations of widely-used testing procedures, 2) the importance of joint modeling of agents for better predictions of interactions, and 3) the vulnerability of current state-of-the-art models against both distribution shifts and targeted attacks by adversarial agents. With STEP, we aim to shift the focus from the ``leaderboard'' approach to deeper insights about model behavior and generalization in complex multi-agent settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Reference Trajectories in Agile Drone Racing: A Unified Reference-Free Model-Based Controller via MPPI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14726v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While model-based controllers have demonstrated remarkable performance in autonomous drone racing, their performance is often constrained by the reliance on pre-computed reference trajectories. Conventional approaches, such as trajectory tracking, demand a dynamically feasible, full-state reference, whereas contouring control relaxes this requirement to a geometric path but still necessitates a reference. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have revealed that many model-based controllers optimize surrogate objectives, such as trajectory tracking, rather than the primary racing goal of directly maximizing progress through gates. Inspired by these findings, this work introduces a reference-free method for time-optimal racing by incorporating this gate progress objective, derived from RL reward shaping, directly into the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) formulation. The sampling-based nature of MPPI makes it uniquely capable of optimizing the discontinuous and non-differentiable objective in real-time. We also establish a unified framework that leverages MPPI to systematically and fairly compare three distinct objective functions with a consistent dynamics model and parameter set: classical trajectory tracking, contouring control, and the proposed gate progress objective. We compare the performance of these three objectives when solved via both MPPI and a traditional gradient-based solver. Our results demonstrate that the proposed reference-free approach achieves competitive racing performance, rivaling or exceeding reference-based methods.

| **[Controllable Surface Diffusion Generative Model for Neurodevelopmental Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03706v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preterm birth disrupts the typical trajectory of cortical neurodevelopment, increasing the risk of cognitive and behavioral difficulties. However, outcomes vary widely, posing a significant challenge for early prediction. To address this, individualized simulation offers a promising solution by modeling subject-specific neurodevelopmental trajectories, enabling the identification of subtle deviations from normative patterns that might act as biomarkers of risk. While generative models have shown potential for simulating neurodevelopment, prior approaches often struggle to preserve subject-specific cortical folding patterns or to reproduce region-specific morphological variations. In this paper, we present a novel graph-diffusion network that supports controllable simulation of cortical maturation. Using cortical surface data from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP), we demonstrate that the model maintains subject-specific cortical morphology while modeling cortical maturation sufficiently well to fool an independently trained age regression network, achieving a prediction accuracy of $0.85 \pm 0.62$.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we use the Fr\'{e}chet mean, and metrics based on the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) construct, to extend the notion of average from vectors to trajectories and multi-object trajectories. Further, we develop efficient algorithms to compute these means using greedy search and Gibbs sampling. Using distributed multi-object tracking as an application, we demonstrate that the Fr\'{e}chet mean approach to multi-object trajectory consensus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed multi-object tracking methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Global Search for Optimal Low Thrust Spacecraft Trajectories using Diffusion Models and the Indirect Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07005v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long time-duration low-thrust nonlinear optimal spacecraft trajectory global search is a computationally and time expensive problem characterized by clustering patterns in locally optimal solutions. During preliminary mission design, mission parameters are subject to frequent changes, necessitating that trajectory designers efficiently generate high-quality control solutions for these new scenarios. Generative machine learning models can be trained to learn how the solution structure varies with respect to a conditional parameter, thereby accelerating the global search for missions with updated parameters. In this work, state-of-the-art diffusion models are integrated with the indirect approach for trajectory optimization within a global search framework. This framework is tested on two low-thrust transfers of different complexity in the circular restricted three-body problem. By generating and analyzing a training data set, we develop mathematical relations and techniques to understand the complex structures in the costate domain of locally optimal solutions for these problems. A diffusion model is trained on this data and successfully accelerates the global search for both problems. The model predicts how the costate solution structure changes, based on the maximum spacecraft thrust magnitude. Warm-starting a numerical solver with diffusion model samples for the costates at the initial time increases the number of solutions generated per minute for problems with unseen thrust magnitudes by one to two orders of magnitude in comparison to samples from a uniform distribution and from an adjoint control transformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ensemble of Pre-Trained Models for Long-Tailed Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13914v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work explores the application of ensemble modeling to the multidimensional regression problem of trajectory prediction for vehicles in urban environments. As newer and bigger state-of-the-art prediction models for autonomous driving continue to emerge, an important open challenge is the problem of how to combine the strengths of these big models without the need for costly re-training. We show how, perhaps surprisingly, combining state-of-the-art deep learning models out-of-the-box (without retraining or fine-tuning) with a simple confidence-weighted average method can enhance the overall prediction. Indeed, while combining trajectory prediction models is not straightforward, this simple approach enhances performance by 10% over the best prediction model, especially in the long-tailed metrics. We show that this performance improvement holds on both the NuScenes and Argoverse datasets, and that these improvements are made across the dataset distribution. The code for our work is open source.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted 2025 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Repulsive Trajectory Modification and Conflict Resolution for Efficient Multi-Manipulator Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13882v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an efficient motion planning method designed to efficiently find collision-free trajectories for multiple manipulators. While multi-manipulator systems offer significant advantages, coordinating their motions is computationally challenging owing to the high dimensionality of their composite configuration space. Conflict-Based Search (CBS) addresses this by decoupling motion planning, but suffers from subsequent conflicts incurred by resolving existing conflicts, leading to an exponentially growing constraint tree of CBS. Our proposed method is based on repulsive trajectory modification within the two-level structure of CBS. Unlike conventional CBS variants, the low-level planner applies a gradient descent approach using an Artificial Potential Field. This field generates repulsive forces that guide the trajectory of the conflicting manipulator away from those of other robots. As a result, subsequent conflicts are less likely to occur. Additionally, we develop a strategy that, under a specific condition, directly attempts to find a conflict-free solution in a single step without growing the constraint tree. Through extensive tests including physical robot experiments, we demonstrate that our method consistently reduces the number of expanded nodes in the constraint tree, achieves a higher success rate, and finds a solution faster compared to Enhanced CBS and other state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> | 7 pages |

We present TrajBooster, a cross-embodiment framework that leverages abundant wheeled-humanoid data to boost bipedal VLA. Our key idea is to use end-effector trajectories as a morphology-agnostic interface. TrajBooster (i) extracts 6D dual-arm end-effector trajectories from real-world wheeled humanoids, (ii) retargets them in simulation to Unitree G1 with a whole-body controller trained via a heuristic-enhanced harmonized online DAgger to lift low-dimensional trajectory references into feasible high-dimensional whole-body actions, and (iii) forms heterogeneous triplets that couple source vision/language with target humanoid-compatible actions to post-pre-train a VLA, followed by only 10 minutes of teleoperation data collection on the target humanoid domain. Deployed on Unitree G1, our policy achieves beyond-tabletop household tasks, enabling squatting, cross-height manipulation, and coordinated whole-body motion with markedly improved robustness and generalization. Results show that TrajBooster allows existing wheeled-humanoid data to efficiently strengthen bipedal humanoid VLA performance, reducing reliance on costly same-embodiment data while enhancing action space understanding and zero-shot skill transfer capabilities.

| **[Disturbance-Aware Dynamical Trajectory Planning for Air-Land Bimodal Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05972v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Air-land bimodal vehicles provide a promising solution for navigating complex environments by combining the flexibility of aerial locomotion with the energy efficiency of ground mobility. However, planning dynamically feasible, smooth, collision-free, and energy-efficient trajectories remains challenging due to two key factors: 1) unknown dynamic disturbances in both aerial and terrestrial domains, and 2) the inherent complexity of managing bimodal dynamics with distinct constraint characteristics. This paper proposes a disturbance-aware motion-planning framework that addresses this challenge through real-time disturbance estimation and adaptive trajectory generation. The framework comprises two key components: 1) a disturbance-adaptive safety boundary adjustment mechanism that dynamically determines the feasible region of dynamic constraints for both air and land modes based on estimated disturbances via a disturbance observer, and 2) a constraint-adaptive bimodal motion planner that integrates disturbance-aware path searching to guide trajectories toward regions with reduced disturbances and B-spline-based trajectory optimization to refine trajectories within the established feasible constraint boundaries. Experimental validation on a self-developed air-land bimodal vehicle demonstrates substantial performance improvements across three representative disturbance scenarios, achieving an average 33.9% reduction in trajectory tracking error while still maintaining superior time-energy trade-offs compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Aware: Adaptive Multi-Mode Out-of-Distribution Detection for Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13577v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is central to the safe and seamless operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In deployment, however, prediction models inevitably face distribution shifts between training data and real-world conditions, where rare or underrepresented traffic scenarios induce out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. While most prior OOD detection research in AVs has concentrated on computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation, trajectory-level OOD detection remains largely underexplored. A recent study formulated this problem as a quickest change detection (QCD) task, providing formal guarantees on the trade-off between detection delay and false alarms [1]. Building on this foundation, we propose a new framework that introduces adaptive mechanisms to achieve robust detection in complex driving environments. Empirical analysis across multiple real-world datasets reveals that prediction errors -- even on in-distribution samples -- exhibit mode-dependent distributions that evolve over time with dataset-specific dynamics. By explicitly modeling these error modes, our method achieves substantial improvements in both detection delay and false alarm rates. Comprehensive experiments on established trajectory prediction benchmarks show that our framework significantly outperforms prior UQ- and vision-based OOD approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical path toward reliable, driving-aware autonomy.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

While many distillation methods that are solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in few-step video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Occupancy-aware Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Valet Parking in Uncertain Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09206v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Valet Parking (AVP) requires planning under partial observability, where parking spot availability evolves as dynamic agents enter and exit spots. Existing approaches either rely only on instantaneous spot availability or make static assumptions, thereby limiting foresight and adaptability. We propose an approach that estimates probability of future spot occupancy by distinguishing initially vacant and occupied spots while leveraging nearby dynamic agent motion. We propose a probabilistic estimator that integrates partial, noisy observations from a limited Field-of-View, with the evolving uncertainty of unobserved spots. Coupled with the estimator, we design a strategy planner that balances goal-directed parking maneuvers with exploratory navigation based on information gain, and incorporates wait-and-go behaviors at promising spots. Through randomized simulations emulating large parking lots, we demonstrate that our framework significantly improves parking efficiency and trajectory smoothness over existing approaches, while maintaining safety margins.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporally Smooth Mesh Extraction for Procedural Scenes with Long-Range Camera Trajectories using Spacetime Octrees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13306v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The procedural occupancy function is a flexible and compact representation for creating 3D scenes. For rasterization and other tasks, it is often necessary to extract a mesh that represents the shape. Unbounded scenes with long-range camera trajectories, such as flying through a forest, pose a unique challenge for mesh extraction. A single static mesh representing all the geometric detail necessary for the full camera path can be prohibitively large. Therefore, independent meshes can be extracted for different camera views, but this approach may lead to popping artifacts during transitions. We propose a temporally coherent method for extracting meshes suitable for long-range camera trajectories in unbounded scenes represented by an occupancy function. The key idea is to perform 4D mesh extraction using a new spacetime tree structure called a binary-octree. Experiments show that, compared to existing baseline methods, our method offers superior visual consistency at a comparable cost.

Data unlearning has emerged to mitigate this issue by removing the influence of specific data without retraining from scratch. We propose ReTrack, a fast and effective data unlearning method for diffusion models. ReTrack employs importance sampling to construct a more efficient fine-tuning loss, which we approximate by retaining only dominant terms. This yields an interpretable objective that redirects denoising trajectories toward the $k$-nearest neighbors, enabling efficient unlearning while preserving generative quality. Experiments on MNIST T-Shirt, CelebA-HQ, CIFAR-10, and Stable Diffusion show that ReTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, striking the best trade-off between unlearning strength and generation quality preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal graph neural process for reconstruction, extrapolation, and classification of cardiac trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12953v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a probabilistic framework for modeling structured spatiotemporal dynamics from sparse observations, focusing on cardiac motion. Our approach integrates neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and neural processes into a unified model that captures uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure. We represent dynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent trajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context observations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over latent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and extrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic dynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto oscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK Biobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and disease classification capabilities. The model accurately reconstructs trajectories and extrapolates future cardiac cycles from a single observed cycle. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ACDC classification task (up to 99% accuracy), and detects atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank subjects with competitive performance (up to 67% accuracy). This work introduces a flexible approach for analyzing cardiac motion and offers a foundation for graph-based learning in structured biomedical spatiotemporal time-series data.</p></details> |  |

Transferring its generative capabilities to modern end-to-end autonomous driving systems has also emerged as a promising direction. However, existing diffusion-based trajectory generative models often exhibit mode collapse where different random noises converge to similar trajectories after the denoising process.Therefore, state-of-the-art models often rely on anchored trajectories from pre-defined trajectory vocabulary or scene priors in the training set to mitigate collapse and enrich the diversity of generated trajectories, but such inductive bias are not available in real-world deployment, which can be challenged when generalizing to unseen scenarios. In this work, we investigate the possibility of effectively tackling the mode collapse challenge without the assumption of pre-defined trajectory vocabulary or pre-computed scene priors. Specifically, we propose TransDiffuser, an encoder-decoder based generative trajectory planning model, where the encoded scene information and motion states serve as the multi-modal conditional input of the denoising decoder. Different from existing approaches, we exploit a simple yet effective multi-modal representation decorrelation optimization mechanism during the denoising process to enrich the latent representation space which better guides the downstream generation. Without any predefined trajectory anchors or pre-computed scene priors, TransDiffuser achieves the PDMS of 94.85 on the closed-loop planning-oriented benchmark NAVSIM, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative evaluation further showcases TransDiffuser generates more diverse and plausible trajectories which explore more drivable area.</p></details> | Under review |

Existing quadrupedal jumping studies mainly focused on the stance and flight phase by assuming a flat landing ground, which is impractical in many real world cases. This work proposes a safe landing framework that achieves adaptive landing on rough terrains by combining Trajectory Optimization (TO) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) together. The RL agent learns to track the reference motion generated by TO in the environments with rough terrains. To enable the learning of compliant landing skills on challenging terrains, a reward relaxation strategy is synthesized to encourage exploration during landing recovery period.

| **[Towards Bio-Inspired Robotic Trajectory Planning via Self-Supervised RNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02171v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning in robotics is understood as generating a sequence of joint configurations that will lead a robotic agent, or its manipulator, from an initial state to the desired final state, thus completing a manipulation task while considering constraints like robot kinematics and the environment. Typically, this is achieved via sampling-based planners, which are computationally intensive. Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning can also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often requiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural architecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised approaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on whether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce observed trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent architecture for building a trajectory model. We evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method on a task of kinematic planning for a robotic arm. The results suggest that the model is able to learn to generate trajectories only using given paired forward and inverse kinematics models, and indicate that this novel method could facilitate planning for more complex manipulation tasks requiring adaptive solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables.

| **[VH-Diffuser: Variable Horizon Diffusion Planner for Time-Aware Goal-Conditioned Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11930v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based planners have gained significant recent attention for their robustness and performance in long-horizon tasks. However, most existing planners rely on a fixed, pre-specified horizon during both training and inference. This rigidity often produces length-mismatch (trajectories that are too short or too long) and brittle performance across instances with varying geometric or dynamical difficulty. In this paper, we introduce the Variable Horizon Diffuser (VHD) framework, which treats the horizon as a learned variable rather than a fixed hyperparameter. Given a start-goal pair, we first predict an instance-specific horizon using a learned Length Predictor model, which guides a Diffusion Planner to generate a trajectory of the desired length. Our design maintains compatibility with existing diffusion planners by controlling trajectory length through initial noise shaping and training on randomly cropped sub-trajectories, without requiring architectural changes. Empirically, VHD improves success rates and path efficiency in maze-navigation and robot-arm control benchmarks, showing greater robustness to horizon mismatch and unseen lengths, while keeping training simple and offline-only.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods, however, often struggle to capture the full richness of these dynamics, particularly the co-existence of multi-scale interactions and the diverse behaviors of heterogeneous agents. To address these challenges, this paper introduces HeLoFusion, an efficient and scalable encoder for modeling heterogeneous and multi-scale agent interactions. Instead of relying on global context, HeLoFusion constructs local, multi-scale graphs centered on each agent, allowing it to effectively model both direct pairwise dependencies and complex group-wise interactions (\textit{e.g.}, platooning vehicles or pedestrian crowds). Furthermore, HeLoFusion tackles the critical challenge of agent heterogeneity through an aggregation-decomposition message-passing scheme and type-specific feature networks, enabling it to learn nuanced, type-dependent interaction patterns. This locality-focused approach enables a principled representation of multi-level social context, yielding powerful and expressive agent embeddings. On the challenging Waymo Open Motion Dataset, HeLoFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting new benchmarks for key metrics including Soft mAP and minADE. Our work demonstrates that a locality-grounded architecture, which explicitly models multi-scale and heterogeneous interactions, is a highly effective strategy for advancing motion forecasting.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory and communication optimization for low-altitude air-ground cooperation systems, where mobile unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) upload data to UAVs. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to maximize the minimal sum-rate of UGVs while ensuring quality of service and navigation constraints. The proposed algorithm integrates a successive convex approximation (SCA)-penalty method for UGV-UAV scheduling, an SCA-based approach for UGV transmit power control, and a novel warm-start particle swarm optimization with cross mutation (WS-PSO-CM). The WS-PSO-CM leverages convex optimization results from a statistical channel model to initialize particle swarm, significantly improving the performance, compared with celebrated PSO-CM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a $45.8$\% higher minimal sum-rate compared to the baseline PSO-CM under the same iterations. This gain can be translated to reducing computational time by $46.7$\% of PSO-CM. Furthermore, our simulation results reveal that UAVs dynamically adjust trajectories to avoid interference by buildings, and maintain proximity to UGVs to mitigate path-loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; 7 figures; accepted by GC-2026-Workshops</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Frame-wise Tracking: A Trajectory-based Paradigm for Efficient Point Cloud Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11453v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical task in robotics and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation, TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers.

Recently, large-scale pretrained foundation models have been leveraged as shared priors for perception, reasoning, and action, enabling zero-shot VLN without task-specific training. However, existing zero-shot VLN methods depend on costly perception and passive scene understanding, collapsing control to point-level choices. As a result, they are expensive to deploy, misaligned in action semantics, and short-sighted in planning. To address these issues, we present DreamNav that focuses on the following three aspects: (1) for reducing sensory cost, our EgoView Corrector aligns viewpoints and stabilizes egocentric perception; (2) instead of point-level actions, our Trajectory Predictor favors global trajectory-level planning to better align with instruction semantics; and (3) to enable anticipatory and long-horizon planning, we propose an Imagination Predictor to endow the agent with proactive thinking capability. On VLN-CE and real-world tests, DreamNav sets a new zero-shot state-of-the-art (SOTA), outperforming the strongest egocentric baseline with extra information by up to 7.49\% and 18.15\% in terms of SR and SPL metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first zero-shot VLN method to unify trajectory-level planning and active imagination while using only egocentric inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tracailer: An Efficient Trajectory Planner for Tractor-Trailer Robots in Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19832v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tractor-trailer robot consists of a drivable tractor and one or more non-drivable trailers connected via hitches. Compared to typical car-like robots, the addition of trailers provides greater transportation capability. However, this also complicates motion planning due to the robot's complex kinematics, high-dimensional state space, and deformable structure. To efficiently plan safe, time-optimal trajectories that adhere to the kinematic constraints of the robot and address the challenges posed by its unique features, this paper introduces a lightweight, compact, and high-order smooth trajectory representation for tractor-trailer robots. Based on it, we design an efficiently solvable spatial-temporal trajectory optimization problem. To deal with deformable structures, which leads to difficulties in collision avoidance, we fully leverage the collisionfree regions of the environment, directly applying deformations to trajectories in continuous space. This approach not requires constructing safe regions from the environment using convex approximations through collision-free seed points before each optimization, avoiding the loss of the solution space, thus reducing the dependency of the optimization on initial values. Moreover, a multi-terminal fast path search algorithm is proposed to generate the initial values for optimization.

Existing methods struggle with sparse data, incomplete routes, and limited modeling of complex spatial dependencies, often relying on low-level check-in data or ignoring spatial patterns. In this paper, we introduced GCN-TULHOR, a method that transforms raw location data into higher-order mobility flow representations using hexagonal tessellation, reducing data sparsity and capturing richer spatial semantics, and integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Our approach converts both sparse check-in and continuous GPS trajectory data into unified higher-order flow representations, mitigating sparsity while capturing deeper semantic information. The GCN layer explicitly models complex spatial relationships and non-local dependencies without requiring side information such as timestamps or points of interest. Experiments on six real-world datasets show consistent improvements over classical baselines, RNN- and Transformer-based models, and the TULHOR method in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. GCN-TULHOR achieves 1-8% relative gains in accuracy and F1. Sensitivity analysis identifies an optimal setup with a single GCN layer and 512-dimensional embeddings. The integration of GCNs enhances spatial learning and improves generalizability across mobility data. This work highlights the value of combining graph-based spatial learning with sequential modeling, offering a robust and scalable solution for TUL with applications in recommendations, urban planning, and security.</p></details> |  |

The new estimate is $O(N^{-1/2})$, with a constant related to the probability of success of the bound, given by Hoeffding's inequality, similar to other methodologies, such as Philipp et al. Furthermore, we propose a \textit{lifting back} operator to obtain trajectories generated by embedding the initial state and iterating a linear system in a higher dimension. This naturally yields an $O(N^{-1/2})$ error bound for mean trajectories. Finally, we show numerical results including an example of nonlinear system, exhibiting successful approximation with exponential decay faster than $-1/2$, as suggested by the theoretical results.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

To improve prediction accuracy, recent approaches often rely on pre-built high-definition (HD) maps or real-time local map construction modules to incorporate static environmental information. However, pre-built HD maps are limited to specific regions and cannot adapt to transient changes. In addition, local map construction modules, which recognize only predefined elements, may fail to capture critical scene details or introduce errors that degrade prediction performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Bird's-Eye View Trajectory Prediction (BEVTraj), a novel trajectory prediction framework that operates directly in the bird's-eye view (BEV) space utilizing real-time sensor data without relying on any pre-built maps. The BEVTraj leverages deformable attention to efficiently extract relevant context from dense BEV features. Furthermore, we introduce a Sparse Goal Candidate Proposal (SGCP) module, which enables full end-to-end prediction without requiring any post-processing steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the BEVTraj achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art HD map-based models while offering greater flexibility by eliminating the dependency on pre-built maps.

In response, analyses of social media (SM) language have gained prominence due to their high temporal resolution and longitudinal scope. Here, we introduce a method to determine the timing of users' diagnoses and apply it to study language trajectories from 3 years before to 21 years after BD diagnosis - contrasted with uses reporting unipolar depression (UD) and non-affected users (HC). We show that BD diagnosis is accompanied by pervasive linguistic alterations reflecting mood disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, substance abuse, hospitalization, medical comorbidities, unusual thought content, and disorganized thought. We further observe recurring mood-related language changes across two decades after the diagnosis, with a pronounced 12-month periodicity suggestive of seasonal mood episodes. Finally, trend-level evidence suggests an increased periodicity in users estimated to be female. In sum, our findings provide evidence for language alterations in the acute and chronic phase of BD. This validates and extends recent efforts leveraging SM for scalable monitoring of mental health.</p></details> | Pre-print |
| **[Self-Augmented Robot Trajectory: Efficient Imitation Learning via Safe Self-augmentation with Demonstrator-annotated Precision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09893v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning is a promising paradigm for training robot agents; however, standard approaches typically require substantial data acquisition -- via numerous demonstrations or random exploration -- to ensure reliable performance. Although exploration reduces human effort, it lacks safety guarantees and often results in frequent collisions -- particularly in clearance-limited tasks (e.g., peg-in-hole) -- thereby, necessitating manual environmental resets and imposing additional human burden. This study proposes Self-Augmented Robot Trajectory (SART), a framework that enables policy learning from a single human demonstration, while safely expanding the dataset through autonomous augmentation. SART consists of two stages: (1) human teaching only once, where a single demonstration is provided and precision boundaries -- represented as spheres around key waypoints -- are annotated, followed by one environment reset; (2) robot self-augmentation, where the robot generates diverse, collision-free trajectories within these boundaries and reconnects to the original demonstration. This design improves the data collection efficiency by minimizing human effort while ensuring safety. Extensive evaluations in simulation and real-world manipulation tasks show that SART achieves substantially higher success rates than policies trained solely on human-collected demonstrations.

Existing methods typically rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets. Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification, which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and zero-shot approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Foundation Models for Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10570v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction serves as a critical functionality in autonomous driving, enabling the anticipation of future motion paths for traffic participants such as vehicles and pedestrians, which is essential for driving safety. Although conventional deep learning methods have improved accuracy, they remain hindered by inherent limitations, including lack of interpretability, heavy reliance on large-scale annotated data, and weak generalization in long-tail scenarios. The rise of Large Foundation Models (LFMs) is transforming the research paradigm of trajectory prediction. This survey offers a systematic review of recent advances in LFMs, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for trajectory prediction. By integrating linguistic and scene semantics, LFMs facilitate interpretable contextual reasoning, significantly enhancing prediction safety and generalization in complex environments. The article highlights three core methodologies: trajectory-language mapping, multimodal fusion, and constraint-based reasoning. It covers prediction tasks for both vehicles and pedestrians, evaluation metrics, and dataset analyses. Key challenges such as computational latency, data scarcity, and real-world robustness are discussed, along with future research directions including low-latency inference, causality-aware modeling, and motion foundation models.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |
| **[MGTraj: Multi-Granularity Goal-Guided Human Trajectory Prediction with Recursive Refinement Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09200v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities: coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.</p></details> |  |

If a planned trajectory violates traffic rules, it is common to replan a new trajectory from scratch. We instead propose a trajectory repair technique to save computation time. By coupling satisfiability modulo theories with set-based reachability analysis, we determine if and in what manner the initial trajectory can be repaired. Experiments in high-fidelity simulators and in the real world demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach in various scenarios. Even in complex environments with intricate rules, we efficiently and reliably repair rule-violating trajectories, enabling automated vehicles to swiftly resume legally safe operation in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE.

Existing methods often face high computational cost or rely on external safety critics. To address this, we propose an Interaction-Enriched Unified Potential Field (IUPF) framework that fuses style-dependent benefit and risk fields through a physics-inspired variational model, grounded in mean field game theory. The approach captures conservative, aggressive, and cooperative behaviors without additional safety modules, and employs stochastic differential equations to guarantee Nash equilibrium with exponential convergence. Simulations on lane changing and overtaking scenarios show that IUPF ensures safe distances, generates smooth and efficient trajectories, and outperforms traditional optimization and game-theoretic baselines in both adaptability and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

We apply this framework to three datasets from the Datasaurus Dozen bullseye, dino, and circle using a simplified DDPM architecture with customizable input and time embeddings. Our approach quantifies trajectory properties, including displacement, velocity, clustering, and drift field dynamics, using statistical metrics such as Wasserstein distance and cosine similarity. By enhancing model transparency, InJecteD supports human AI collaboration by enabling practitioners to debug and refine generative models. Experiments reveal distinct denoising phases: initial noise exploration, rapid shape formation, and final refinement, with dataset-specific behaviors example, bullseyes concentric convergence vs. dinos complex contour formation. We evaluate four model configurations, varying embeddings and noise schedules, demonstrating that Fourier based embeddings improve trajectory stability and reconstruction quality</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Gradient Waveform Design for Arbitrary $k$-Space Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21625v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>\textbf{Objective: }To develop a real-time method for designing gradient waveforms for arbitrary $k$-space trajectories that are time-optimal and hardware-compliant. \textbf{Methods: }The gradient waveform is solved recursively under both the slew-rate and the trajectory constraints. The gradient constraint is enforced by thresholding the $\ell_2$-norm of the next gradient vector. The constraints form a quadratic equation. To ensure the existence of the solution, a novel Discrete-Time Forward and Backward Sweep (DTFBS) strategy is proposed. To ensure the existence of the trajectory derivatives, the trajectory function is reparameterized as a piecewise cubic polynomial function with $C^2$ continuity. To ensure trajectory fidelity, the output gradient waveform is reparameterized by the finite difference of the trajectory samples. Simulation experiments across seven commonly adopted non-Cartesian trajectories were conducted to validate generality, time-optimality, real-time capability, slew-rate accuracy, and improvements over prior work. Imaging feasibility of the designed time-optimal gradient waveform was validated in phantom and in vivo experiments. \textbf{Results: }The proposed method achieves a $>89\%$ reduction in computation time and simultaneously reduces slew-rate overshoot by $>98\%$ compared to the prior method across all involved trajectories. The computation time of the proposed method is shorter than the gradient duration for all tested cases, validating the real-time capability of the proposed method. \textbf{Conclusions: }The proposed method enables real-time and hardware-compliant gradient waveform design, achieving significant reductions in computation time and slew-rate overshoot compared to the previous method. \textbf{Significance: }This is the first method achieving real-time gradient waveform design for arbitrary $k$-space trajectories.</p></details> |  |

While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Generalized Hamiltonian Dynamics with Stability from Noisy Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07280v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a robust framework for learning various generalized Hamiltonian dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data and in an unsupervised manner based on variational Bayesian inference. Although conservative, dissipative, and port-Hamiltonian systems might share the same initial total energy of a closed system, it is challenging for a single Hamiltonian network model to capture the distinctive and varying motion dynamics and physics of a phase space, from sampled observational phase space trajectories. To address this complicated Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge, we extend sparse symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes learning with predictive successive numerical estimations of the Hamiltonian landscape, using a generalized form of state and conjugate momentum Hamiltonian dynamics, appropriate to different classes of conservative, dissipative and port-Hamiltonian physical systems. In addition to the kernelized evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation constraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the model's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction accuracy with bounded uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often assume fixed graph structures and require retraining when network conditions change, making them unsuitable for deployment on constrained hardware. We present TrajAware, an RL-based framework designed for edge AI deployment in VANETs. TrajAware integrates three components: (i) action space pruning, which reduces redundant neighbour options while preserving two-hop reachability, alleviating the curse of dimensionality; (ii) graph cross-attention, which maps pruned neighbours to the global graph context, producing features that generalise across diverse network sizes; and (iii) trajectory-aware prediction, which uses historical routes and junction information to estimate real-time positions under partial observations. We evaluate TrajAware in the open-source SUMO simulator using real-world city maps with a leave-one-city-out setup. Results show that TrajAware achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Resident fitness computation in linear time and other algorithmic aspects of interacting trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11561v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The notion of a system of interacting trajectories was recently introduced by Hermann, Gonz\'alez Casanova, Soares dos Santos, T\'obi\'as and Wakolbinger. Such a system of $[0,1]$-valued piecewise linear trajectories arises as a scaling limit of the system of logarithmic subpopulation sizes in a population-genetic model (more precisely, a Moran model) with mutation and selection. By definition, the resident fitness is initially 0 and afterwards it increases by the ultimate slope of each trajectory that reaches height 1. We show that although the interaction of $n$ trajectories may yield $\Omega(n^2)$ slope changes in total, the resident fitness function can be computed algorithmically in $O(n)$ time. Our algorithm uses the so-called continued lines representation of the system of interacting trajectories. In the special case of Poissonian interacting trajectories where the birth times of the trajectories form a Poisson process and the initial slopes are random and i.i.d., we provide a linear bound on the expected total number of slope changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v5)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

| **[Statistical description and dimension reduction of categorical trajectories with multivariate functional principal components](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09986v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are many examples in which the statistical units of interest are samples of a continuous time categorical random process, that is to say a continuous time stochastic process taking values in a finite state space. Getting simple representations that allow comparisons of a set of trajectories is of major interest for statisticians. Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical description of the categorical trajectories into a multivariate functional principal components analysis. The (multivariate) covariance operator has nice interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities and the multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, it is simple to build consistent estimators of the covariance kernel and perform multivariate functional principal components analysis. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories are not supposed to be continuous and can be observed exhaustively. The approach is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments. We also show how it can be easily extended to analyze experiments, such as temporal check-all-that-apply, in which two states or more can be observed at the same time.</p></details> |  |

This growing deployment presents new challenges for UAV trajectory planning in complex urban environments. However, existing studies often overlook key factors, such as urban airspace constraints and economic efficiency, which are essential in low-altitude economy contexts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising solution to these issues, while its practical adoption remains limited by low learning efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel UAV trajectory planning framework that combines DRL with large language model (LLM) reasoning to enable safe, compliant, and economically viable path planning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple metrics, including data collection rate, collision avoidance, successful landing, regulatory compliance, and energy efficiency. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing UAV trajectory planning key challenges under constraints of the low-altitude economy networking.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior learning-based methods, ZLATTE leverages Vision-Language Models to register objects as geometric primitives and employs a Large Language Model to translate natural language instructions into explicit geometric and kinematic constraints. These constraints are integrated into a potential field optimization to adapt initial trajectories while preserving feasibility and safety. A multi-agent strategy further enhances robustness under complex or conflicting commands. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that ZLATTE achieves smoother, safer, and more interpretable trajectory modifications compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Scaling of Diffusion Models via Noise Trajectory Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03164v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The iterative and stochastic nature of diffusion models enables test-time scaling, whereby spending additional compute during denoising generates higher-fidelity samples. Increasing the number of denoising steps is the primary scaling axis, but this yields quickly diminishing returns. Instead optimizing the noise trajectory--the sequence of injected noise vectors--is promising, as the specific noise realizations critically affect sample quality; but this is challenging due to a high-dimensional search space, complex noise-outcome interactions, and costly trajectory evaluations. We address this by first casting diffusion as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a terminal reward, showing tree-search methods such as Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to be meaningful but impractical. To balance performance and efficiency, we then resort to a relaxation of MDP, where we view denoising as a sequence of independent contextual bandits. This allows us to introduce an $\epsilon$-greedy search algorithm that globally explores at extreme timesteps and locally exploits during the intermediate steps where de-mixing occurs. Experiments on EDM and Stable Diffusion reveal state-of-the-art scores for class-conditioned/text-to-image generation, exceeding baselines by up to $164\%$ and matching/exceeding MCTS performance. To our knowledge, this is the first practical method for test-time noise trajectory optimization of arbitrary (non-differentiable) rewards.</p></details> |  |
| **[MENSA: A Multi-Event Network for Survival Analysis with Trajectory-based Likelihood Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06525v4)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing time-to-event methods focus on either single-event or competing-risk settings, leaving multi-event scenarios relatively underexplored. In many real-world applications, the same patient may experience multiple events that are non-exclusive, and sometimes semi-competing. A common workaround is to train separate single-event models, but this approach fails to exploit dependencies and shared structure across events. To address these limitations, we propose MENSA (Multi-Event Network for Survival Analysis), a deep learning model that jointly models flexible time-to-event distributions for multiple events, whether competing or co-occurring. In addition, we introduce a novel trajectory-based likelihood that captures the temporal ordering between events. Across five benchmark datasets, MENSA consistently improves prediction performance over many state-of-the-art baselines.

While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity, computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present the Efficient Virtuoso, a conditional latent diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, achieving a minimum Average Displacement Error (minADE) of 0.25. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.</p></details> |  |

We also assume that we have a method to solve the inverse kinematic problem of the manipulator at each via-point of the trajectory. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, we calculate the feasible region of the manipulator under a specific configuration of the end-effector. Next, we aim to find a trajectory on the line segments and a sequence of joint configurations the manipulator should follow to move the end-effector along the specified trajectory. Finally, we find the optimal combination of solutions to the inverse kinematic problem at each via-point along the trajectory by reducing the problem to a shortest-path problem of the graph and applying Dijkstra's algorithm. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by experiments.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Learning to Coordinate: Distributed Meta-Trajectory Optimization Via Differentiable ADMM-DDP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01630v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Acceleration Preconditioners for Parametric Radiative Transfer Equations based on Trajectory-Aware Reduced Order Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05001v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The parametric radiative transfer equation (RTE) arises in multi-query applications, such as design optimization, inverse problems, and uncertainty quantification, which require solving the RTE multiple times for various parameters. Classical synthetic acceleration (SA) preconditioners are designed based on low-order approximations of a kinetic correction equation, e.g., its diffusion limit in diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA). Despite their widespread success, these methods rely on empirical physical assumptions and do not leverage low-rank structures across parameters of the parametric problem. To address these limitations, our previous work introduced a reduced-order model (ROM) enhanced preconditioner called ROMSAD, which exploits low-rank structures across parameters and the original kinetic description of the correction equation. While ROMSAD improves overall efficiency compared with DSA, its efficiency reduces after the first iteration, because the construction of the underlying ROM ignores the preconditioner-dependence of the residual trajectory, leading to a mismatch between the offline and online residual trajectories. To overcome this issue, we introduce a trajectory-aware framework that iteratively constructs ROMs to eliminate the mismatch between offline and online residual trajectories. Numerical tests demonstrate superior efficiency over DSA, and substantial gains in both efficiency and robustness over ROMSAD. For a parametric lattice problem, trajectory-aware ROM preconditioners achieve rapid convergence within only $2$-$3$ iterations online.</p></details> | 32 pages, 9 figures |

While human-motion-centric approaches excel in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods. Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.</p></details> |  |

While radiomics methods seek surrogate markers of lesion heterogeneity on CT/MRI, many aggregate features across the region of interest (ROI) and miss complex spatial relationships among varying intensity compositions. We present a new Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) descriptor for characterizing intralesional heterogeneity (ILH) on clinical MRI scans. GrRAiL (1) identifies clusters of sub-regions using per-voxel radiomic measurements, then (2) computes graph-theoretic metrics to quantify spatial associations among clusters. The resulting weighted graphs encode higher-order spatial relationships within the ROI, aiming to reliably capture ILH and disambiguate confounding pathologies from malignancy. To assess efficacy and clinical feasibility, GrRAiL was evaluated in n=947 subjects spanning three use cases: differentiating tumor recurrence from radiation effects in glioblastoma (GBM; n=106) and brain metastasis (n=233), and stratifying pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) into no+low vs high risk (n=608). In a multi-institutional setting, GrRAiL consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines - Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), textural radiomics, and intensity-graph analysis. In GBM, cross-validation (CV) and test accuracies for recurrence vs pseudo-progression were 89% and 78% with >10% test-accuracy gains over comparators. In brain metastasis, CV and test accuracies for recurrence vs radiation necrosis were 84% and 74% (>13% improvement). For IPMN risk stratification, CV and test accuracies were 84% and 75%, showing >10% improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review: npj Digital Medicine</p></details> |

However, extracting general chemical insight while balancing predictive accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture that combines compressed higher-order topological signals with standard molecular features. Our approach captures global geometric information while preserving computational tractability and human-interpretable structure. We evaluate our model across a range of benchmarks, from small-molecule datasets to complex material datasets, and demonstrate superior performance using a parameter-efficient architecture. We achieve the best performing results in both accuracy and robustness across almost all benchmarks.

| **[Graph Neural Networks with Similarity-Navigated Probabilistic Feature Copying](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19084v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various graph-based tasks. However, they face some fundamental limitations: feature oversmoothing can cause node representations to become indistinguishable in deeper networks, they struggle to effectively manage heterogeneous relationships where connected nodes differ significantly, and they process entire feature vectors as indivisible units, which limits flexibility. We seek to address these limitations. We propose AxelGNN, a novel GNN architecture inspired by Axelrod's cultural dissemination model that addresses these limitations through a unified framework. AxelGNN incorporates similarity-gated probabilistic interactions that adaptively promote convergence or divergence based on node similarity, implements trait-level copying mechanisms for fine-grained feature aggregation at the segment level, and maintains global polarization to preserve node distinctiveness across multiple representation clusters. The model's bistable convergence dynamics naturally handle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs within a single architecture. Extensive experiments on node classification and influence estimation benchmarks demonstrate that AxelGNN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art GNN methods across diverse graph structures with varying homophily-heterophily characteristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynami-CAL GraphNet: A Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network Conserving Linear and Angular Momentum for Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07373v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for predicting behaviors and inferring physical properties in natural and engineered environments. Traditional physics-based models face scalability challenges and are computationally demanding, while data-driven approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often lack physical consistency, interpretability, and generalization. In this paper, we propose Dynami-CAL GraphNet, a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network that integrates the learning capabilities of GNNs with physics-based inductive biases to address these limitations. Dynami-CAL GraphNet enforces pairwise conservation of linear and angular momentum for interacting nodes using edge-local reference frames that are equivariant to rotational symmetries, invariant to translations, and equivariant to node permutations. This design ensures physically consistent predictions of node dynamics while offering interpretable, edge-wise linear and angular impulses resulting from pairwise interactions. Evaluated on a 3D granular system with inelastic collisions, Dynami-CAL GraphNet demonstrates stable error accumulation over extended rollouts, effective extrapolations to unseen configurations, and robust handling of heterogeneous interactions and external forces. Dynami-CAL GraphNet offers significant advantages in fields requiring accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of complex multi-body dynamical systems, such as robotics, aerospace engineering, and materials science. By providing physically consistent and scalable predictions that adhere to fundamental conservation laws, it enables the inference of forces and moments while efficiently handling heterogeneous interactions and external forces.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViG-LRGC: Vision Graph Neural Networks with Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18840v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Representation Learning is an important problem in Computer Vision. Traditionally, images were processed as grids, using Convolutional Neural Networks or as a sequence of visual tokens, using Vision Transformers. Recently, Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViG) have proposed the treatment of images as a graph of nodes; which provides a more intuitive image representation. The challenge is to construct a graph of nodes in each layer that best represents the relations between nodes and does not need a hyper-parameter search. ViG models in the literature depend on non-parameterized and non-learnable statistical methods that operate on the latent features of nodes to create a graph. This might not select the best neighborhood for each node. Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph Construction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack the ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction method. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies key-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold reparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable mathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the neighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding methods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows tuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds are learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the model. We demonstrate that the proposed ViG-LRGC approach outperforms state-of-the-art ViG models of similar sizes on the ImageNet-1k benchmark dataset.</p></details> | Under Review |

Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is an emerging learning framework to collaboratively train graph data from various clients. However, since clients are required to upload model parameters to the server in each round, this provides the server with an opportunity to infer each client's data privacy. In this paper, we focus on label distribution attacks(LDAs) that aim to infer the label distributions of the clients' local data. We take the first step to attack client's label distributions in FGL. Firstly, we observe that the effectiveness of LDA is closely related to the variance of node embeddings in GNNs. Next, we analyze the relation between them and we propose a new attack named EC-LDA, which significantly improves the attack effectiveness by compressing node embeddings. Thirdly, extensive experiments on node classification and link prediction tasks across six widely used graph datasets show that EC-LDA outperforms the SOTA LDAs. For example, EC-LDA attains optimal values under both Cos-sim and JS-div evaluation metrics in the CoraFull and LastFM datasets. Finally, we explore the robustness of EC-LDA under differential privacy protection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06743v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning. Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range interactions are captured through a flexible spectral-domain parameterization. This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: New Perspectives in Advancing Graph Machine Learning</p></details> |

Existing methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), mostly focus on static TAGs. Extending these existing methods to DyTAGs is challenging as they largely neglect the recent-global temporal semantics: the recent semantic dependencies among interaction texts and the global semantic evolution of nodes over time. Furthermore, applying LLMs to the abundant and evolving text in DyTAGs faces efficiency issues. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic Global-Recent Adaptive Semantic Processing (DyGRASP), a novel method that leverages LLMs and temporal GNNs to efficiently and effectively reason on DyTAGs. Specifically, we first design a node-centric implicit reasoning method together with a sliding window mechanism to efficiently capture recent temporal semantics. In addition, to capture global semantic dynamics of nodes, we leverage explicit reasoning with tailored prompts and an RNN-like chain structure to infer long-term semantics. Lastly, we intricately integrate the recent and global temporal semantics as well as the dynamic graph structural information using updating and merging layers. Extensive experiments on DyTAG benchmarks demonstrate DyGRASP's superiority, achieving up to 34% improvement in Hit@10 for destination node retrieval task. Besides, DyGRASP exhibits strong generalization across different temporal GNNs and LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[ABG-NAS: Adaptive Bayesian Genetic Neural Architecture Search for Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21254v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective and efficient graph representation learning is essential for enabling critical downstream tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and subgraph search. However, existing graph neural network (GNN) architectures often struggle to adapt to diverse and complex graph structures, limiting their ability to produce structure-aware and task-discriminative representations. To address this challenge, we propose ABG-NAS, a novel framework for automated graph neural network architecture search tailored for efficient graph representation learning. ABG-NAS encompasses three key components: a Comprehensive Architecture Search Space (CASS), an Adaptive Genetic Optimization Strategy (AGOS), and a Bayesian-Guided Tuning Module (BGTM). CASS systematically explores diverse propagation (P) and transformation (T) operations, enabling the discovery of GNN architectures capable of capturing intricate graph characteristics. AGOS dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring search efficiency and preserving solution diversity. BGTM further optimizes hyperparameters periodically, enhancing the scalability and robustness of the resulting architectures. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets (Cora, PubMed, Citeseer, and CoraFull) demonstrate that ABG-NAS consistently outperforms both manually designed GNNs and state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods. These results highlight the potential of ABG-NAS to advance graph representation learning by providing scalable and adaptive solutions for diverse graph structures.

| **[GALLa: Graph Aligned Large Language Models for Improved Source Code Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04183v4)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programming languages possess rich semantic information - such as data flow - that is represented by graphs and not available from the surface form of source code. Recent code language models have scaled to billions of parameters, but model source code solely as text tokens while ignoring any other structural information. Conversely, models that do encode structural information of code make modifications to the Transformer architecture, limiting their scale and compatibility with pretrained LLMs. In this work, we take the best of both worlds with GALLa - Graph Aligned Large Language Models. GALLa utilizes graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment technologies to inject the structural information of code into LLMs as an auxiliary task during finetuning. This framework is both model-agnostic and task-agnostic, as it can be applied to any code LLM for any code downstream task, and requires the structural graph data only at training time from a corpus unrelated to the finetuning data, while incurring no cost at inference time over the baseline LLM. Experiments on five code tasks with seven different baseline LLMs ranging in size from 350M to 14B validate the effectiveness of GALLa, demonstrating consistent improvement over the baseline, even for powerful models such as LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5-Coder.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks for Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10270v6)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose new scattering networks for signals measured on simplicial complexes, which we call \emph{Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks} (MHSNs). Our construction builds on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial complexes -- namely, the $\kappa$-GHWT and $\kappa$-HGLET -- which we recently developed for simplices of dimension $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ in a given simplicial complex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar--Walsh Transform (GHWT) and Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). Both the $\kappa$-GHWT and the $\kappa$-HGLET form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs adopt a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN), cascading the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation -- akin to local pooling in CNNs -- that can be performed either locally or per scale. Such pooling operations are more difficult to define in traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets and in geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, our approach extracts a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be combined with simple machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression or support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification with far fewer trainable parameters than most modern graph neural networks require. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MHSNs on three distinct problem types: signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 Pa...</summary><p>20 Pages, Comments Welcome</p></details> |

Its clinical and biological heterogeneity makes diagnosis and subtype differentiation highly challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown strong potential in modeling brain connectivity, but their limited robustness, data scarcity, and lack of interpretability constrain clinical adoption. Explainable Graph Neural Networks (XGNNs) have emerged to address these barriers by combining graph-based learning with interpretability, enabling the identification of disease-relevant biomarkers, analysis of brain network disruptions, and provision of transparent insights for clinicians. This paper presents the first comprehensive review dedicated to XGNNs in dementia research. We examine their applications across Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and multi-disease diagnosis. A taxonomy of explainability methods tailored for dementia-related tasks is introduced, alongside comparisons of existing models in clinical scenarios. We also highlight challenges such as limited generalizability, underexplored domains, and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) for early detection. By outlining both progress and open problems, this review aims to guide future work toward trustworthy, clinically meaningful, and scalable use of XGNNs in dementia research.</p></details> |  |

Automated Anti-money laundering (AML) models, like Graph Neural Networks (GNN), can be trained to identify illicit transactions in real time. A major issue for developing such models is the lack of access to training data due to privacy and confidentiality concerns. Synthetically generated data that mimics the statistical properties of real data but preserves privacy and confidentiality has been proposed as a solution. However, training AML models on purely synthetic datasets presents its own set of challenges. This article proposes the use of hybrid datasets to augment the utility of synthetic datasets by incorporating publicly available, easily accessible, and real-world features. These additions demonstrate that hybrid datasets not only preserve privacy but also improve model utility, offering a practical pathway for financial institutions to enhance AML systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) Research Institute Annual Meeting, Las Vegas, NV, (2024)</p></details> |
| **[Estimating Heterogeneous Causal Effect on Networks via Orthogonal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18484v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating causal effects on networks is important for both scientific research and practical applications. Unlike traditional settings that assume the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), interference allows an intervention/treatment on one unit to affect the outcomes of others. Understanding both direct and spillover effects is critical in fields such as epidemiology, political science, and economics. Causal inference on networks faces two main challenges. First, causal effects are typically heterogeneous, varying with unit features and local network structure. Second, connected units often exhibit dependence due to network homophily, creating confounding between structural correlations and causal effects. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method to estimate heterogeneous direct and spillover effects on networks. The first stage uses graph neural networks to estimate nuisance components that depend on the complex network topology. In the second stage, we adjust for network confounding using these estimates and infer causal effects through a novel attention-based interference model. Our approach balances expressiveness and interpretability, enabling downstream tasks such as identifying influential neighborhoods and recovering the sign of spillover effects. We integrate the two stages using Neyman orthogonalization and cross-fitting, which ensures that errors from nuisance estimation contribute only at higher order. As a result, our causal effect estimates are robust to bias and misspecification in modeling causal effects under network dependencies.</p></details> |  |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogate models for mesh-based data, their standard autoregressive application for long-term prediction is often plagued by error accumulation and instability. To address this, we introduce MeshODENet, a general framework that synergizes the spatial reasoning of GNNs with the continuous-time modeling of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and versatility on a series of challenging structural mechanics problems, including one- and two-dimensional elastic bodies undergoing large, non-linear deformations. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline models in long-term predictive accuracy and stability, while achieving substantial computational speed-ups over traditional solvers. This work presents a powerful and generalizable approach for developing data-driven surrogates to accelerate the analysis and modeling of complex structural systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

While local explanations offer insights into individual predictions, global explanation methods, those that characterize an entire class, remain underdeveloped. Existing global explainers rely on motif discovery in small graphs, an approach that breaks down in large, real-world settings where subgraph repetition is rare, node attributes are high-dimensional, and predictions arise from complex structure-attribute interactions. We propose GnnXemplar, a novel global explainer inspired from Exemplar Theory from cognitive science. GnnXemplar identifies representative nodes in the GNN embedding space, exemplars, and explains predictions using natural language rules derived from their neighborhoods. Exemplar selection is framed as a coverage maximization problem over reverse k-nearest neighbors, for which we provide an efficient greedy approximation. To derive interpretable rules, we employ a self-refining prompt strategy using large language models (LLMs). Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that GnnXemplar significantly outperforms existing methods in fidelity, scalability, and human interpretability, as validated by a user study with 60 participants.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 20 figures, NeurIPS 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[A Graph-Neural-Network-Entropy model of vital node identification on network attack and propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18325v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vital nodes usually play a key role in complex networks. Uncovering these nodes is an important task in protecting the network, especially when the network suffers intentional attack. Many existing methods have not fully integrated the node feature, interaction and state. In this article, we propose a novel method (GNNE) based on graph neural networks and information entropy. The method employs a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to learn the nodes' features, which are input into a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to obtain the influence factor of nodes, and the node influence factors are used to calculate the nodes' entropy to evaluate the node importance. The GNNE takes advantage of the GCN and GAT, with the GCN well extracting the nodes' features and the GAT aggregating the features of the nodes' neighbors by using the attention mechanism to assign different weights to the neighbors with different importance, and the nodes' entropy quantifies the nodes' state in the network. The proposed method is trained on a synthetic Barabasi-Albert network, and tested on six real datasets. Compared with eight traditional topology-based methods and four graph-machine-learning-based methods, the GNNE shows an advantage for the vital node identification in the perspectives of network attack and propagation.</p></details> |  |

Our approach combines anatomically-informed graph structures with contrastive learning to address key challenges in handshape recognition, including subtle interclass distinctions and temporal variations. We establish the first benchmark for structured handshape recognition in signing sequences, achieving 46% accuracy across 37 handshape classes (with baseline methods achieving 25%).</p></details> |  |
| **[Budgeted Adversarial Attack against Graph-Based Anomaly Detection in Sensor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17987v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for anomaly detection in sensor networks, particularly when analyzing multivariate time series. In this work, we introduce BETA, a novel grey-box evasion attack targeting such GNN-based detectors, where the attacker is constrained to perturb sensor readings from a limited set of nodes, excluding the target sensor, with the goal of either suppressing a true anomaly or triggering a false alarm at the target node. BETA identifies the sensors most influential to the target node's classification and injects carefully crafted adversarial perturbations into their features, all while maintaining stealth and respecting the attacker's budget. Experiments on three real-world sensor network datasets show that BETA reduces the detection accuracy of state-of-the-art GNN-based detectors by 30.62 to 39.16% on average, and significantly outperforms baseline attack strategies, while operating within realistic constraints.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Interpreting Graph Inference with Skyline Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07635v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference queries have been routinely issued to graph machine learning models such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for various network analytical tasks. Nevertheless, GNN outputs are often hard to interpret comprehensively. Existing methods typically conform to individual pre-defined explainability measures (such as fidelity), which often leads to biased, ``one-side'' interpretations. This paper introduces skyline explanation, a new paradigm that interprets GNN outputs by simultaneously optimizing multiple explainability measures of users' interests. (1) We propose skyline explanations as a Pareto set of explanatory subgraphs that dominate others over multiple explanatory measures. We formulate skyline explanation as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and establish its hardness results. (2) We design efficient algorithms with an onion-peeling approach, which strategically prioritizes nodes and removes unpromising edges to incrementally assemble skyline explanations. (3) We also develop an algorithm to diversify the skyline explanations to enrich the comprehensive interpretation. (4) We introduce efficient parallel algorithms with load-balancing strategies to scale skyline explanation for large-scale GNN-based inference. Using real-world and synthetic graphs, we experimentally verify our algorithms' effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpreting GNN-based IDS Detections Using Provenance Graph Structural Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00934v6)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced cyber threats (e.g., Fileless Malware and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)) have driven the adoption of provenance-based security solutions. These solutions employ Machine Learning (ML) models for behavioral modeling and critical security tasks such as malware and anomaly detection. However, the opacity of ML-based security models limits their broader adoption, as the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes restricts explainability and verifiability. We tailored our solution towards Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based security solutions since recent studies employ GNNs to comprehensively digest system provenance graphs for security-critical tasks. To enhance the explainability of GNN-based security models, we introduce PROVEXPLAINER, a framework offering instance-level security-aware explanations using an interpretable surrogate model. PROVEXPLAINER's interpretable feature space consists of discriminant subgraph patterns and graph structural features, which can be directly mapped to the system provenance problem space, making the explanations human interpretable. We show how PROVEXPLAINER synergizes with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN explainers to deliver domain and instance-specific explanations. We measure the explanation quality using the Fidelity+/Fidelity- metric as used by traditional GNN explanation literature, we incorporate the precision/recall metric, where we consider the accuracy of the explanation against the ground truth, and we designed a human actionability metric based on graph traversal distance. On real-world Fileless and APT datasets, PROVEXPLAINER achieves up to 29%/27%/25%/1.4x higher Fidelity+, precision, recall, and actionability (where higher values are better), and 12% lower Fidelity- (where lower values are better) when compared against SOTA GNN explainers.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScaleGNN: Towards Scalable Graph Neural Networks via Adaptive High-order Neighboring Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15920v5)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance across diverse graph-based tasks by leveraging message passing to capture complex node relationships. However, when applied to large-scale real-world graphs, GNNs face two major challenges: First, it becomes increasingly difficult to ensure both scalability and efficiency, as the repeated aggregation of large neighborhoods leads to significant computational overhead; Second, the over-smoothing problem arises, where excessive or deep propagation makes node representations indistinguishable, severely hindering model expressiveness. To tackle these issues, we propose ScaleGNN, a novel framework that adaptively fuses multi-hop node features for both scalable and effective graph learning. First, we construct per-hop pure neighbor matrices that capture only the exclusive structural information at each hop, avoiding the redundancy of conventional aggregation. Then, an enhanced feature fusion strategy significantly balances low-order and high-order information, preserving both local detail and global correlations without incurring excessive complexity. To further reduce redundancy and over-smoothing, we introduce a Local Contribution Score (LCS)-based masking mechanism to filter out less relevant high-order neighbors, ensuring that only the most meaningful information is aggregated. In addition, learnable sparse constraints selectively integrate multi-hop valuable features, emphasizing the most informative high-order neighbors. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ScaleGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, highlighting its practical value for large-scale graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[FastNet: Improving the physical consistency of machine-learning weather prediction models through loss function design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17601v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) models have demonstrated remarkable potential in delivering accurate forecasts at significantly reduced computational cost compared to traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. However, challenges remain in ensuring the physical consistency of MLWP outputs, particularly in deterministic settings. This study presents FastNet, a graph neural network (GNN)-based global prediction model, and investigates the impact of alternative loss function designs on improving the physical realism of its forecasts. We explore three key modifications to the standard mean squared error (MSE) loss: (1) a modified spherical harmonic (MSH) loss that penalises spectral amplitude errors to reduce blurring and enhance small-scale structure retention; (2) inclusion of horizontal gradient terms in the loss to suppress non-physical artefacts; and (3) an alternative wind representation that decouples speed and direction to better capture extreme wind events. Results show that while the MSH and gradient-based losses \textit{alone} may slightly degrade RMSE scores, when trained in combination the model exhibits very similar MSE performance to an MSE-trained model while at the same time significantly improving spectral fidelity and physical consistency. The alternative wind representation further improves wind speed accuracy and reduces directional bias. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of loss function design as a mechanism for embedding domain knowledge into MLWP models and advancing their operational readiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Periodic Graph-Enhanced Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17472v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection commonly encounters in various domains like finance, healthcare, and industrial monitoring. However, existing MTS anomaly detection methods are mostly defined on the static graph structure, which fails to perform an accurate representation of complex spatio-temporal correlations in MTS. To address this issue, this study proposes a Periodic Graph-Enhanced Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detector (PGMA) with the following two-fold ideas: a) designing a periodic time-slot allocation strategy based Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which enables the graph structure to reflect dynamic changes in MTS; b) utilizing graph neural network and temporal extension convolution to accurate extract the complex spatio-temporal correlations from the reconstructed periodic graphs. Experiments on four real datasets from real applications demonstrate that the proposed PGMA outperforms state-of-the-art models in MTS anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preserving Node-level Privacy in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06888v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential privacy (DP) has seen immense applications in learning on tabular, image, and sequential data where instance-level privacy is concerned. In learning on graphs, contrastingly, works on node-level privacy are highly sparse. Challenges arise as existing DP protocols hardly apply to the message-passing mechanism in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this study, we propose a solution that specifically addresses the issue of node-level privacy. Our protocol consists of two main components: 1) a sampling routine called HeterPoisson, which employs a specialized node sampling strategy and a series of tailored operations to generate a batch of sub-graphs with desired properties, and 2) a randomization routine that utilizes symmetric multivariate Laplace (SML) noise instead of the commonly used Gaussian noise. Our privacy accounting shows this particular combination provides a non-trivial privacy guarantee. In addition, our protocol enables GNN learning with good performance, as demonstrated by experiments on five real-world datasets; compared with existing baselines, our method shows significant advantages, especially in the high privacy regime. Experimentally, we also 1) perform membership inference attacks against our protocol and 2) apply privacy audit techniques to confirm our protocol's privacy integrity. In the sequel, we present a study on a seemingly appealing approach \cite{sajadmanesh2023gap} (USENIX'23) that protects node-level privacy via differentially private node/instance embeddings. Unfortunately, such work has fundamental privacy flaws, which are identified through a thorough case study. More importantly, we prove an impossibility result of achieving both (strong) privacy and (acceptable) utility through private instance embedding. The implication is that such an approach has intrinsic utility barriers when enforcing differential privacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphTorque: Torque-Driven Rewiring Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21422v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process, motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to improve representation learning in heterophilous and homophilous graphs. Specifically, we define the torque by treating the feature distance as a lever arm vector and the neighbor feature as a force vector weighted by the homophily disparity between nodes. We use the metric to hierarchically reconfigure receptive field of each layer by judiciously pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing the impact of irrelevant information and boosting pertinent signals during message passing. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art rewiring methods on both heterophilous and homophilous graphs.</p></details> |  |

The architecture learns node features at different resolutions with skip connections between the encoder and decoder paths, analogous to the convolutional U-Net for image generation. The U-GNN is prominent for a pooling operation that leverages zero-padding and avoids arbitrary graph coarsening, with graph convolutions layered on top to capture local dependencies. This technique permits learning feature embeddings for sampled nodes at deeper levels of the architecture that remain convolutional with respect to the original graph. Applied to stock price prediction -- where deterministic forecasts struggle to capture uncertainties and tail events that are paramount -- we demonstrate the effectiveness of the diffusion model in probabilistic forecasting of stock prices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2026 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2026)</p></details> |

We formulate the allocation problem as the maximization of an ergodic utility function subject to ergodic Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. Given samples from a stochastic expert policy that yields a near-optimal solution to the constrained optimization problem, we train a GDM policy to imitate the expert and generate new samples from the optimal distribution. We achieve near-optimal performance through the sequential execution of the generated samples. To enable generalization to a family of network configurations, we parameterize the backward diffusion process with a graph neural network (GNN) architecture. We present numerical results in a case study of power control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP'25)</p></details> |
| **[Prospective Multi-Graph Cohesion for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17235v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in high-dimensional time series data is pivotal for numerous industrial applications. Recent advances in multivariate time series anomaly detection (TSAD) have increasingly leveraged graph structures to model inter-variable relationships, typically employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Despite their promising results, existing methods often rely on a single graph representation, which are insufficient for capturing the complex, diverse relationships inherent in multivariate time series. To address this, we propose the Prospective Multi-Graph Cohesion (PMGC) framework for multivariate TSAD. PMGC exploits spatial correlations by integrating a long-term static graph with a series of short-term instance-wise dynamic graphs, regulated through a graph cohesion loss function. Our theoretical analysis shows that this loss function promotes diversity among dynamic graphs while aligning them with the stable long-term relationships encapsulated by the static graph. Additionally, we introduce a "prospective graphing" strategy to mitigate the limitations of traditional forecasting-based TSAD methods, which often struggle with unpredictable future variations. This strategy allows the model to accurately reflect concurrent inter-series relationships under normal conditions, thereby enhancing anomaly detection efficacy. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing TSAD techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 18th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (ACM WSDM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[A Scalable Multi-Robot Framework for Decentralized and Asynchronous Perception-Action-Communication Loops](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10164v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaboration in large robot swarms to achieve a common global objective is a challenging problem in large environments due to limited sensing and communication capabilities. The robots must execute a Perception-Action-Communication (PAC) loop -- they perceive their local environment, communicate with other robots, and take actions in real time. A fundamental challenge in decentralized PAC systems is to decide what information to communicate with the neighboring robots and how to take actions while utilizing the information shared by the neighbors. Recently, this has been addressed using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for applications such as flocking and coverage control. Although conceptually, GNN policies are fully decentralized, the evaluation and deployment of such policies have primarily remained centralized or restrictively decentralized. Furthermore, existing frameworks assume sequential execution of perception and action inference, which is very restrictive in real-world applications. This paper proposes a framework for asynchronous PAC in robot swarms, where decentralized GNNs are used to compute navigation actions and generate messages for communication. In particular, we use aggregated GNNs, which enable the exchange of hidden layer information between robots for computational efficiency and decentralized inference of actions. Furthermore, the modules in the framework are asynchronous, allowing robots to perform sensing, extracting information, communication, action inference, and control execution at different frequencies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNNs executed in the proposed framework in navigating large robot swarms for collaborative coverage of large environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expressive Power of Graph Neural Networks for (Mixed-Integer) Quadratic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05938v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quadratic programming (QP) is the most widely applied category of problems in nonlinear programming. Many applications require real-time/fast solutions, though not necessarily with high precision. Existing methods either involve matrix decomposition or use the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. For relatively large instances, these methods cannot achieve the real-time requirement unless there is an effective preconditioner. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) opened new possibilities for QP. Some promising empirical studies of applying GNNs for QP tasks show that GNNs can capture key characteristics of an optimization instance and provide adaptive guidance accordingly to crucial configurations during the solving process, or directly provide an approximate solution. However, the theoretical understanding of GNNs in this context remains limited. Specifically, it is unclear what GNNs can and cannot achieve for QP tasks in theory. This work addresses this gap in the context of linearly constrained QP tasks. In the continuous setting, we prove that message-passing GNNs can universally represent fundamental properties of convex quadratic programs, including feasibility, optimal objective values, and optimal solutions. In the more challenging mixed-integer setting, while GNNs are not universal approximators, we identify a subclass of QP problems that GNNs can reliably represent.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose a graph-based neural inference model that simultaneously predicts neural activity and infers latent connectivity by modeling neurons as interacting nodes in a graph. The architecture features two distinct modules: one for learning structural connectivity and another for predicting future spiking activity via a graph neural network (GNN). Our model accommodates unobserved neurons through auxiliary nodes, allowing for inference in partially observed circuits. We evaluate this approach using synthetic data from ring attractor networks and real spike recordings from head direction cells in mice. Across a wide range of conditions, including varying recurrent connectivity, external inputs, and incomplete observations, our model consistently outperforms standard baselines, resolving spurious correlations more effectively and recovering accurate weight profiles. When applied to real data, the inferred connectivity aligns with theoretical predictions of continuous attractor models. These results highlight the potential of GNN-based models to infer latent neural circuitry through self-supervised structure learning, while leveraging the spike prediction task to flexibly link connectivity and dynamics across both simulated and biological neural systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

The two networks interact with each other at the layer level to find a saddle point of the Lagrangian. The primal GNN finds a stationary point for a given dual multiplier, while the dual network iteratively refines its estimates to reach an optimal solution. We force the primal and dual networks to mirror the dynamics of the DA algorithm by imposing descent and ascent constraints. We propose a joint training scheme that alternates between updating the primal and dual networks. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach yields near-optimal near-feasible solutions and generalizes well to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepEOSNet: Capturing the dependency on thermodynamic state in property prediction tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17018v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a machine learning (ML) architecture to better capture the dependency of thermodynamic properties on the independent states. When predicting state-dependent thermodynamic properties, ML models need to account for both molecular structure and the thermodynamic state, described by independent variables, typically temperature, pressure, and composition. Modern molecular ML models typically include state information by adding it to molecular fingerprint vectors or by embedding explicit (semi-empirical) thermodynamic relations. Here, we propose to rather split the information processing on the molecular structure and the dependency on states into two separate network channels: a graph neural network and a multilayer perceptron, whose output is combined by a dot product. We refer to our approach as DeepEOSNet, as this idea is based on the DeepONet architecture [Lu et al. (2021), Nat. Mach. Intell.]: instead of operators, we learn state dependencies, with the possibility to predict equation of states (EOS). We investigate the predictive performance of DeepEOSNet by means of three case studies, which include the prediction of vapor pressure as a function of temperature, and mixture molar volume as a function of composition, temperature, and pressure. Our results show superior performance of DeepEOSNet for predicting vapor pressure and comparable performance for predicting mixture molar volume compared to state-of-research graph-based thermodynamic prediction models from our earlier works. In fact, we see large potential of DeepEOSNet in cases where data is sparse in the state domain and the output function is structurally similar across different molecules. The concept of DeepEOSNet can easily be transferred to other ML architectures in molecular context, and thus provides a viable option for property prediction.</p></details> |  |

We integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) together. Firstly, we apply NLP on the user-generated text and conduct semantic analysis, sentiment recognition and keyword extraction to get subtle risk signals from social media posts. Meanwhile, we build a heterogeneous user relationship graph based on social interaction and propose a novel relational graph convolutional network to model user relationship, attention relationship and content dissemination path to discover some important structural information and user behaviors. Finally, we combine textual features extracted from these two models above with graph structural information, which provides a more robust and effective way to discover at-risk users. Our experiments on real social media datasets from different platforms show that our model can achieve significant improvement over single-modality methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tighter Bounds for Personalized PageRank](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14462v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study Personalized PageRank (PPR), where for nodes $s,t$ in a graph $G$, $\pi(s,t)$ is the probability that an $\alpha$-decay random walk from $s$ ends at $t$. Two key queries are: Single-Source PPR (SSPPR), computing $\pi(s,\cdot)$ for fixed $s$, and Single-Target PPR (STPPR), computing $\pi(\cdot,t)$ for fixed $t$. SSPPR is studied under absolute error (SSPPR-A), requiring $|\hat{\pi}(s,t)-\pi(s,t)|\le \epsilon$, and relative error (SSPPR-R), requiring $|\hat{\pi}(s,t)-\pi(s,t)|\le c\pi(s,t)$ for $t$ with $\pi(s,t)\ge \delta$; STPPR adopts the same relative criterion. These queries support web search, recommendation, sparsification, and graph neural networks. The best known upper bounds are $O(\min(\tfrac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\epsilon^{2}},\tfrac{\sqrt{m\log n}}{\epsilon},m\log\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}))$ for SSPPR-A and $O(\min(\tfrac{\log(1/\delta)}{\delta},\sqrt{\tfrac{m\log n}{\delta}},m\log\tfrac{\log n}{\delta m}))$ for SSPPR-R, while lower bounds remain $\Omega(\min(n,1/\epsilon))$, $\Omega(\min(m,1/\delta))$, and $\Omega(\min(n,1/\delta))$, leaving large gaps. We close these gaps by (i) presenting a Monte Carlo algorithm that tightens the SSPPR-A upper bound to $O(1/\epsilon^{2})$, and (ii) proving, via an arc-centric construction, lower bounds $\Omega(\min(m,\tfrac{\log(1/\delta)}{\delta}))$ for SSPPR-R, $\Omega(\min(m,\tfrac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}))$ (and intermediate $\Omega(\min(m,\tfrac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\epsilon}))$) for SSPPR-A, and $\Omega(\min(m,\tfrac{n}{\delta}\log n))$ for STPPR. For practical settings ($\delta=\Theta(1/n)$, $\epsilon=\Theta(n^{-1/2})$, $m\in\Omega(n\log n)$) these bounds meet the best known upper bounds, establishing the optimality of Monte Carlo and FORA for SSPPR-R, our algorithm for SSPPR-A, and RBS for STPPR, and yielding a near-complete complexity landscape for PPR queries.</p></details> | 43 pages |

However, current methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address challenges in olfactory navigation, we introduce a multimodal olfaction dataset along with a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines. This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and training methods, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors, enabling them to detect more compounds and inform better hardware design. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making through better sensor selection for a target compound in critical applications such as explosives detection, narcotics screening, and search and rescue. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of artificial olfaction, offering a scalable solution to challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities.

While recent works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection, they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score, outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While numerous algorithms have been developed to locate TSs efficiently, the computational cost of PES evaluations remains a key limitation. In this work, we develop and fine-tune a graph neural network (GNN) PES to accelerate TS searches for organic reactions. Our GNN of choice, SchNet, is first pre-trained on the ANI-1 dataset and subsequently fine-tuned on a small dataset of reactant, product, and TS structures. We integrate this GNN PES into the Freezing String Method (FSM), enabling rapid generation of TS guess geometries. Across a benchmark suite of chemically diverse reactions, our fine-tuned model (GNN-FT) achieves a 100% success rate, locating the reference TSs in all cases while reducing the number of ab-initio calculations by 72% on average compared to conventional DFT-based FSM searches. Fine-tuning reduces GNN-FT errors by orders of magnitude for out-of-distribution cases such as non-covalent interactions, and improves TS-region predictions with comparatively little data. Analysis of transition state geometries and energy errors shows that GNN-FT captures PES along the reaction coordinate with sufficient accuracy to serve as a reliable DFT surrogate. These results demonstrate that modern GNN potentials, when properly trained, can significantly reduce the cost of TS searches and broaden the scope and size of systems considered in chemical reactivity studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, such data are inherently heterogeneous, high-dimensional, and exhibit complex intra- and inter-modality dependencies. Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) offer powerful tools for modeling such structure. Yet, most existing methods rely on prior knowledge or predefined similarity networks to construct graphs, which are often undirected or unweighted, failing to capture the directionality and strength of biological interactions. Interpretability at both the modality and feature levels also remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose TF-DWGNet, a novel Graph Neural Network framework that combines tree-based Directed Weighted graph construction with Tensor Fusion for multiclass cancer subtype classification. TF-DWGNet introduces two key innovations: a supervised tree-based approach for constructing directed, weighted graphs tailored to each omics modality, and a tensor fusion mechanism that captures unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal interactions using low-rank decomposition for efficiency. TF-DWGNet enables modality-specific representation learning, joint embedding fusion, and interpretable subtype prediction. Experiments on real-world cancer datasets show that TF-DWGNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics and statistical tests. Moreover, it provides biologically meaningful insights by ranking influential features and modalities.

While prior work has primarily focused on synthesizing a planner that sequences pre-learned skills, robust execution of the individual skills themselves remains challenging, as visuomotor policies often fail under distribution shifts induced by scene composition. To address this, we introduce a scene graph-based representation that focuses on task-relevant objects and relations, thereby mitigating sensitivity to irrelevant variation. Building on this idea, we develop a scene-graph skill learning framework that integrates graph neural networks with diffusion-based imitation learning, and further combine "focused" scene-graph skills with a vision-language model (VLM) based task planner. Experiments in both simulation and real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate substantially higher success rates than state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting improved robustness and compositional generalization in long-horizon tasks.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions, including graph rewiring and bottleneck-resistant architectures such as Cayley and expander graphs, avoid this problem but introduce scalability bottlenecks. In particular, the Cayley graphs constructed over $SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_n)$ exhibit strong theoretical properties, yet suffer from cubic node growth $O(n^3)$, leading to high memory usage. To address this, this work introduces Schrier-Coset Graph Propagation (SCGP), a group-theoretic augmentation method that enriches node features through Schreier-coset embeddings without altering the input graph topology. SCGP embeds bottleneck-free connectivity patterns into a compact feature space, improving long-range message passing while maintaining computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations across standard node and graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that SCGP achieves performance comparable to, or exceeding, expander graph and rewired GNN baselines. Furthermore, SCGP exhibits particular advantages in processing hierarchical and modular graph structures, offering reduced inference latency, improved scalability, and a low memory footprint, making it suitable for real-time and resource-constrained applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been updated and now utilizes a more comprehensive methodology, we felt that the name does not do justice to it as their is no graph rewiring involved.

Open in-situ datasets from principled land cover surveys offer a scalable alternative to manual annotation for training such models. However, their sparse spatial coverage often leads to fragmented and noisy predictions when used with existing deep learning-based land cover mapping approaches. A promising direction to address this issue is object-based classification, which assigns labels to semantically coherent image regions rather than individual pixels, thereby imposing a minimum mapping unit. Despite this potential, object-based methods remain underexplored in deep learning-based land cover mapping pipelines, especially in the context of medium-resolution imagery and sparse supervision. To address this gap, we propose LC-SLab, the first deep learning framework for systematically exploring object-based deep learning methods for large-scale land cover classification under sparse supervision. LC-SLab supports both input-level aggregation via graph neural networks, and output-level aggregation by postprocessing results from established semantic segmentation models. Additionally, we incorporate features from a large pre-trained network to improve performance on small datasets. We evaluate the framework on annual Sentinel-2 composites with sparse LUCAS labels, focusing on the tradeoff between accuracy and fragmentation, as well as sensitivity to dataset size. Our results show that object-based methods can match or exceed the accuracy of common pixel-wise models while producing substantially more coherent maps. Input-level aggregation proves more robust on smaller datasets, whereas output-level aggregation performs best with more data. Several configurations of LC-SLab also outperform existing land cover products, highlighting the framework's practical utility.</p></details> |  |

However, current forecasting solutions lack the temporal and spatial resolution required by system operators. In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon. The results are competitive with those achieved by a commercial numerical weather prediction service.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 17 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Optimize Capacity Planning in Semiconductor Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15767v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In manufacturing, capacity planning is the process of allocating production resources in accordance with variable demand. The current industry practice in semiconductor manufacturing typically applies heuristic rules to prioritize actions, such as future change lists that account for incoming machine and recipe dedications. However, while offering interpretability, heuristics cannot easily account for the complex interactions along the process flow that can gradually lead to the formation of bottlenecks. Here, we present a neural network-based model for capacity planning on the level of individual machines, trained using deep reinforcement learning. By representing the policy using a heterogeneous graph neural network, the model directly captures the diverse relationships among machines and processing steps, allowing for proactive decision-making. We describe several measures taken to achieve sufficient scalability to tackle the vast space of possible machine-level actions. Our evaluation results cover Intel's small-scale Minifab model and preliminary experiments using the popular SMT2020 testbed. In the largest tested scenario, our trained policy increases throughput and decreases cycle time by about 1.8% each.</p></details> |  |

It employs an online data quality monitoring (DQM) system to promptly spot and diagnose particle data acquisition problems to avoid data quality loss. In this study, we present a semi-supervised spatio-temporal anomaly detection (AD) monitoring system for the physics particle reading channels of the Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) of the CMS using three-dimensional digi-occupancy map data of the DQM. We propose the GraphSTAD system, which employs convolutional and graph neural networks to learn local spatial characteristics induced by particles traversing the detector and the global behavior owing to shared backend circuit connections and housing boxes of the channels, respectively. Recurrent neural networks capture the temporal evolution of the extracted spatial features. We validate the accuracy of the proposed AD system in capturing diverse channel fault types using the LHC collision data sets. The GraphSTAD system achieves production-level accuracy and is being integrated into the CMS core production system for real-time monitoring of the HCAL. We provide a quantitative performance comparison with alternative benchmark models to demonstrate the promising leverage of the presented system.

However, most approaches are tailored for undirected graphs, neglecting the abundant information in the edges of directed graphs (digraphs). In fact, digraphs are widely applied in the real world and confirmed to address heterophily challenges. Despite recent advancements, existing spatial- and spectral-based DiGNNs have limitations due to their complex learning mechanisms and reliance on high-quality topology, resulting in low efficiency and unstable performance. To address these issues, we propose Directed Random Walk (DiRW), a plug-and-play strategy for most spatial-based DiGNNs and also an innovative model which offers a new digraph learning paradigm. Specifically, it utilizes a direction-aware path sampler optimized from the perspectives of walk probability, length, and number in a weight-free manner by considering node profiles and topologies. Building upon this, DiRW incorporates a node-wise learnable path aggregator for generalized node representations. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that DiRW: (1) enhances most spatial-based methods as a plug-and-play strategy; (2) achieves SOTA performance as a new digraph learning paradigm. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/dhsiuu/DiRW.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Network-assisted Random Forest+](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15611v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning algorithms often assume that training samples are independent. When data points are connected by a network, the induced dependency between samples is both a challenge, reducing effective sample size, and an opportunity to improve prediction by leveraging information from network neighbors. Multiple methods taking advantage of this opportunity are now available, but many, including graph neural networks, are not easily interpretable, limiting their usefulness for understanding how a model makes its predictions. Others, such as network-assisted linear regression, are interpretable but often yield substantially worse prediction performance. We bridge this gap by proposing a family of flexible network-assisted models built upon a generalization of random forests (RF+), which achieves highly-competitive prediction accuracy and can be interpreted through feature importance measures. In particular, we develop a suite of interpretation tools that enable practitioners to not only identify important features that drive model predictions, but also quantify the importance of the network contribution to prediction. Importantly, we provide both global and local importance measures as well as sample influence measures to assess the impact of a given observation. This suite of tools broadens the scope and applicability of network-assisted machine learning for high-impact problems where interpretability and transparency are essential.</p></details> |  |

We present SolarCAST, a causally informed model predicting future global horizontal irradiance (GHI) at a target site using only historical GHI from site X and nearby stations S - unlike prior work that relies on sky-camera or satellite imagery requiring specialized hardware and heavy preprocessing. To deliver high accuracy with only public sensor data, SolarCAST models three classes of confounding factors behind X-S correlations using scalable neural components: (i) observable synchronous variables (e.g., time of day, station identity), handled via an embedding module; (ii) latent synchronous factors (e.g., regional weather patterns), captured by a spatio-temporal graph neural network; and (iii) time-lagged influences (e.g., cloud movement across stations), modeled with a gated transformer that learns temporal shifts. It outperforms leading time-series and multimodal baselines across diverse geographical conditions, and achieves a 25.9% error reduction over the top commercial forecaster, Solcast. SolarCAST offers a lightweight, practical, and generalizable solution for localized solar forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CIKM 2025</p></details> |

To address this, model-level interpretation methods have been developed to explain what patterns maximize probability of predicting to a certain class. However, existing model-level interpretation methods pose several limitations such as generating invalid explanation graphs and lacking reliability. In this paper, we propose a new Generative Interpretation Network for Model-Level Explanation of Graph Neural Networks (GIN-Graph), to generate reliable and high-quality model-level explanation graphs. The implicit and likelihood-free generative adversarial networks are exploited to construct the explanation graphs which are similar to original graphs, meanwhile maximizing the prediction probability for a certain class by adopting a novel objective function for generator with dynamic loss weight scheme. Experimental results indicate that GIN-Graph can be applied to interpret GNNs trained on a variety of graph datasets and generate high-quality explanation graphs with high stability and reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural-Spectral Graph Convolution with Evidential Edge Learning for Hyperspectral Image Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09920v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering assigns similar pixels to the same class without any annotations, which is an important yet challenging task. For large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI, and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator (SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL) module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best compared methods on four HSI datasets.

However, their application to graph structured data, where capturing topological connections is essential, remains underexplored and underperforming compared to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly in the graph clustering task. GNN tends to overemphasize neighborhood aggregation, leading to a homogenization of node representations. Conversely, Transformer tends to over globalize, highlighting distant nodes at the expense of meaningful local patterns. This dichotomy raises a key question: Is attention inherently redundant for unsupervised graph learning? To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis, uncovering the complementary weaknesses of GNN and Transformer in graph clustering. Motivated by these insights, we propose the Attentive Graph Clustering Network (AGCN) a novel architecture that reinterprets the notion that graph is attention. AGCN directly embeds the attention mechanism into the graph structure, enabling effective global information extraction while maintaining sensitivity to local topological cues. Our framework incorporates theoretical analysis to contrast AGCN behavior with GNN and Transformer and introduces two innovations: (1) a KV cache mechanism to improve computational efficiency, and (2) a pairwise margin contrastive loss to boost the discriminative capacity of the attention space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

To solve this problem, exact solution methods based on column generation have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we propose a novel partial column generation strategy for settings with multiple pricing problems, based on predicting which ones are likely to yield columns with a negative reduced cost. We develop a machine learning model tailored to the team formation and routing problem that leverages graph neural networks for these predictions. Computational experiments demonstrate that applying our strategy enhances the solution method and outperforms traditional partial column generation approaches from the literature, particularly on hard instances solved under a tight time limit.</p></details> | 30 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Heterogeneous Directed Hypergraph Neural Network over abstract syntax tree (AST) for Code Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04228v5)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code classification is a difficult issue in program understanding and automatic coding. Due to the elusive syntax and complicated semantics in programs, most existing studies use techniques based on abstract syntax tree (AST) and graph neural networks (GNN) to create code representations for code classification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information of the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect the high-order data correlations that already exist between nodes of the same field or called attribute in the AST, which may result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while a general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous and undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural information such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes and parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) to represent AST and a heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) to process the graph for code classification. Our method improves code understanding and can represent high-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess our heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of Python and Java programs. Our method outperforms previous AST-based and GNN-based methods, which demonstrates the capability of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 35th International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE 2023) as a regular paper; the latest version is consistent with the official conference version</p></details> |

The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to attention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention scheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures long-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer from information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN could be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer, featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network layers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper layers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby preventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective cross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to retain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information loss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of the global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with state-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks. The results indicate that G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping linear complexity.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, their robustness, especially on heterogeneous graphs, remains underexplored, particularly against adversarial attacks. This paper proposes HeteroKRLAttack, a targeted evasion black-box attack method for heterogeneous graphs. By integrating reinforcement learning with a Top-K algorithm to reduce the action space, our method efficiently identifies effective attack strategies to disrupt node classification tasks. We validate the effectiveness of HeteroKRLAttack through experiments on multiple heterogeneous graph datasets, showing significant reductions in classification accuracy compared to baseline methods. An ablation study underscores the critical role of the Top-K algorithm in enhancing attack performance. Our findings highlight potential vulnerabilities in current models and provide guidance for future defense strategies against adversarial attacks on heterogeneous graphs.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods exhibit limited performance when handling hypergraphs, which inherently represent complex high-order relationships beyond pairwise connections. Partitioning hypergraph structures across federated subsystems amplifies structural complexity, hindering high-order information mining and compromising local information integrity. To bridge the gap between hypergraph learning and federated systems, we develop FedHGL, a first-of-its-kind framework for federated hypergraph learning on disjoint and privacy-constrained hypergraph partitions. Beyond collaboratively training a comprehensive hypergraph neural network across multiple clients, FedHGL introduces a pre-propagation hyperedge completion mechanism to preserve high-order structural integrity within each client. This procedure leverages the federated central server to perform cross-client hypergraph convolution without exposing internal topological information, effectively mitigating the high-order information loss induced by subgraph partitioning. Furthermore, by incorporating two kinds of local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms, we provide formal privacy guarantees for this process, ensuring that sensitive node features remain protected against inference attacks from potentially malicious servers or clients. Experimental results on seven real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate its performance advantages over traditional federated graph learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE International Conference on Data Mining 2025 (ICDM2025)</p></details> |

Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks. We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting. The full set of embeddings and sample code are publicly available for researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, preprint; v5: updated authors</p></details> |

In competitive settings such as pursuer-evader tasks, simultaneous adaptation can destabilize training; non-kinetic countermeasures often fail under adverse conditions; and policies trained in one configuration rarely generalize to environments with a different number of agents. To address these issues, we propose the Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (LEGO) framework, which integrates seamlessly with popular MARL algorithms such as MAPPO. LEGO employs graph neural networks to capture permutation equivariance and generalization to different agent numbers, canonicalization to enforce E(n)-equivariance, and heterogeneous representations to encode role-specific inductive biases. Experiments on cooperative and competitive swarm benchmarks show that LEGO outperforms strong baselines and improves generalization. In real-world experiments, LEGO demonstrates robustness to varying team sizes and agent failure.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

It offers insights into collective behavior and decision-making, with applications in Graph Neural Networks. Existing models propose that individuals form opinions based on a weighted average of their peers' opinions and their own beliefs. This averaging process, viewed as a best-response game, can be seen as an individual minimizing disagreements with peers, defined by a quadratic penalty, leading to an equilibrium. Bindel, Kleinberg, and Oren (FOCS 2011) provided tight bounds on the "price of anarchy" defined as the maximum overall disagreement at equilibrium relative to a social optimum. Bhawalkar, Gollapudi, and Munagala (STOC 2013) generalized the penalty function to non-quadratic penalties and provided tight bounds on the price of anarchy. When considering multiple topics, an individual's opinions can be represented as a vector. Parsegov, Proskurnikov, Tempo, and Friedkin (2016) proposed a multidimensional model using the weighted averaging process, but with constant interdependencies between topics. However, the question of the price of anarchy for this model remained open. We address this by providing tight bounds on the multidimensional model, while also generalizing it to more complex interdependencies. Following the work of Bhawalkar, Gollapudi, and Munagala, we provide tight bounds on the price of anarchy under non-quadratic penalties. Surprisingly, these bounds match the scalar model. We further demonstrate that the bounds remain unchanged even when adding another layer of complexity, involving groups of individuals minimizing their overall internal and external disagreement penalty, a common occurrence in real-life scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared in 26th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC'25)</p></details> |

However, current staging models are hardly interpretable, and most public datasets contain no clinical reasoning or interpretation beyond image-level labels. In this paper, we present a novel method that integrates graph representation learning with vision-language models (VLMs) to deliver explainable DR diagnosis. Our approach leverages optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images by constructing biologically informed graphs that encode key retinal vascular features such as vessel morphology and spatial connectivity. A graph neural network (GNN) then performs DR staging while integrated gradients highlight critical nodes and edges and their individual features that drive the classification decisions. We collect this graph-based knowledge which attributes the model's prediction to physiological structures and their characteristics. We then transform it into textual descriptions for VLMs. We perform instruction-tuning with these textual descriptions and the corresponding image to train a student VLM. This final agent can classify the disease and explain its decision in a human interpretable way solely based on a single image input. Experimental evaluations on both proprietary and public datasets demonstrate that our method not only improves classification accuracy but also offers more clinically interpretable results. An expert study further demonstrates that our method provides more accurate diagnostic explanations and paves the way for precise localization of pathologies in OCTA images.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

Existing studies remain fragmented, and there is a lack of comprehensive guidance on how GNNs can be systematically applied to NG-IoT systems. As NG-IoT systems evolve toward 6G, they incorporate diverse technologies. These advances promise unprecedented connectivity, sensing, and automation but also introduce significant complexity, requiring new approaches for scalable learning, dynamic optimization, and secure, decentralized decision-making. This survey provides a comprehensive and forward-looking exploration of how GNNs can empower NG-IoT environments. We commence by exploring the fundamental paradigms of GNNs and articulating the motivation for their use in NG-IoT networks. Besides, we intrinsically connect GNNs with the family of low-density parity-check codes, modeling the NG-IoT as dynamic constrained graphs. We highlight the distinct roles of node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks in tackling key challenges and demonstrate the GNNs' ability to overcome the limitations of traditional optimization. We examine the application of GNNs across core NG-enabling technologies and their integration with distributed frameworks to support privacy-preservation and distributed intelligence.

| **[An End-to-End Differentiable, Graph Neural Network-Embedded Pore Network Model for Permeability Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13841v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of permeability in porous media is essential for modeling subsurface flow. While pure data-driven models offer computational efficiency, they often lack generalization across scales and do not incorporate explicit physical constraints. Pore network models (PNMs), on the other hand, are physics-based and efficient but rely on idealized geometric assumptions to estimate pore-scale hydraulic conductance, limiting their accuracy in complex structures. To overcome these limitations, we present an end-to-end differentiable hybrid framework that embeds a graph neural network (GNN) into a PNM. In this framework, the analytical formulas used for conductance calculations are replaced by GNN-based predictions derived from pore and throat features. The predicted conductances are then passed to the PNM solver for permeability computation. In this way, the model avoids the idealized geometric assumptions of PNM while preserving the physics-based flow calculations. The GNN is trained without requiring labeled conductance data, which can number in the thousands per pore network; instead, it learns conductance values by using a single scalar permeability as the training target. This is made possible by backpropagating gradients through both the GNN (via automatic differentiation) and the PNM solver (via a discrete adjoint method), enabling fully coupled, end-to-end training. The resulting model achieves high accuracy and generalizes well across different scales, outperforming both pure data-driven and traditional PNM approaches. Gradient-based sensitivity analysis further reveals physically consistent feature influences, enhancing model interpretability. This approach offers a scalable and physically informed framework for permeability prediction in complex porous media, reducing model uncertainty and improving accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint is also available at ESS Open Archive: https://essopenarchive.org/users/960205/articles/1329010</p></details> |
| **[State Space Models over Directed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13735v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed graphs are ubiquitous across numerous domains, where the directionality of edges encodes critical causal dependencies. However, existing GNNs and graph Transformers tailored for directed graphs face two major challenges: (1) effectively capturing long-range causal dependencies derived from directed edges; (2) balancing accuracy and training efficiency when processing large-scale graph datasets. In recent years, state space models (SSMs) have achieved substantial progress in causal sequence tasks, and their variants designed for graphs have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining high efficiency across various graph learning benchmarks. However, existing graph state space models are exclusively designed for undirected graphs, which limits their performance in directed graph learning. To this end, we propose an innovative approach DirEgo2Token which sequentializes directed graphs via k-hop ego graphs. This marks the first systematic extension of state space models to the field of directed graph learning. Building upon this, we develop DirGraphSSM, a novel directed graph neural network architecture that implements state space models on directed graphs via the message-passing mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that DirGraphSSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on three representative directed graph learning tasks while attaining competitive performance on two additional tasks with 1.5$\times $ to 2$\times $ training speed improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>curre...</summary><p>currently undergoing review by IEEE Transactions on Big Data</p></details> |
| **[Property-Isometric Variational Autoencoders for Sequence Modeling and Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14287v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biological sequence design (DNA, RNA, or peptides) with desired functional properties has applications in discovering novel nanomaterials, biosensors, antimicrobial drugs, and beyond. One common challenge is the ability to optimize complex high-dimensional properties such as target emission spectra of DNA-mediated fluorescent nanoparticles, photo and chemical stability, and antimicrobial activity of peptides across target microbes. Existing models rely on simple binary labels (e.g., binding/non-binding) rather than high-dimensional complex properties. To address this gap, we propose a geometry-preserving variational autoencoder framework, called PrIVAE, which learns latent sequence embeddings that respect the geometry of their property space. Specifically, we model the property space as a high-dimensional manifold that can be locally approximated by a nearest neighbor graph, given an appropriately defined distance measure. We employ the property graph to guide the sequence latent representations using (1) graph neural network encoder layers and (2) an isometric regularizer. PrIVAE learns a property-organized latent space that enables rational design of new sequences with desired properties by employing the trained decoder. We evaluate the utility of our framework for two generative tasks: (1) design of DNA sequences that template fluorescent metal nanoclusters and (2) design of antimicrobial peptides. The trained models retain high reconstruction accuracy while organizing the latent space according to properties. Beyond in silico experiments, we also employ sampled sequences for wet lab design of DNA nanoclusters, resulting in up to 16.1-fold enrichment of rare-property nanoclusters compared to their abundance in training data, demonstrating the practical utility of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 figures, preprint</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Hate Detection Using Dual-Stream Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13515v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hateful videos present serious risks to online safety and real-world well-being, necessitating effective detection methods. Although multimodal classification approaches integrating information from several modalities outperform unimodal ones, they typically neglect that even minimal hateful content defines a video's category. Specifically, they generally treat all content uniformly, instead of emphasizing the hateful components. Additionally, existing multimodal methods cannot systematically capture structured information in videos, limiting the effectiveness of multimodal fusion. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal dual-stream graph neural network model. It constructs an instance graph by separating the given video into several instances to extract instance-level features. Then, a complementary weight graph assigns importance weights to these features, highlighting hateful instances. Importance weights and instance features are combined to generate video labels. Our model employs a graph-based framework to systematically model structured relationships within and across modalities. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that our model is state-of-the-art in hateful video classification and has strong explainability.

| **[JANUS: A Dual-Constraint Generative Framework for Stealthy Node Injection Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13266v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various applications, yet they are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks, particularly node injection attacks. The success of such attacks heavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original graph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness by relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental characteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local structures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework, called Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local level, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve geometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate structured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the generated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the semantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a sequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning agent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS framework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack effectiveness and stealthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Heterophilic Graphs: A Spectral Theory Perspective on the Impact of Self-Loops and Parallel Edges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13139v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph heterophily poses a formidable challenge to the performance of Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (MP-GNNs). The familiar low-pass filters like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) face performance degradation, which can be attributed to the blending of the messages from dissimilar neighboring nodes. The performance of the low-pass filters on heterophilic graphs still requires an in-depth analysis. In this context, we update the heterophilic graphs by adding a number of self-loops and parallel edges. We observe that eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian decrease and increase respectively by increasing the number of self-loops and parallel edges. We conduct several studies regarding the performance of GCN on various benchmark heterophilic networks by adding either self-loops or parallel edges. The studies reveal that the GCN exhibited either increasing or decreasing performance trends on adding self-loops and parallel edges. In light of the studies, we established connections between the graph spectra and the performance trends of the low-pass filters on the heterophilic graphs. The graph spectra characterize the essential intrinsic properties of the input graph like the presence of connected components, sparsity, average degree, cluster structures, etc. Our work is adept at seamlessly evaluating graph spectrum and properties by observing the performance trends of the low-pass filters without pursuing the costly eigenvalue decomposition. The theoretical foundations are also discussed to validate the impact of adding self-loops and parallel edges on the graph spectrum.</p></details> |  |
| **[Curriculum Learning for Mesh-based simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13138v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogates for mesh-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but training them on high-resolution unstructured meshes with hundreds of thousands of nodes remains prohibitively expensive. We study a \emph{coarse-to-fine curriculum} that accelerates convergence by first training on very coarse meshes and then progressively introducing medium and high resolutions (up to \(3\times10^5\) nodes). Unlike multiscale GNN architectures, the model itself is unchanged; only the fidelity of the training data varies over time. We achieve comparable generalization accuracy while reducing total wall-clock time by up to 50\%. Furthermore, on datasets where our model lacks the capacity to learn the underlying physics, using curriculum learning enables it to break through plateaus.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce second-order tensorial partial differential equations on graphs (SoTPDEG) and propose the first theoretically grounded framework for second-order continuous product graph neural networks (GNNs). Our method exploits the separability of cosine kernels in Cartesian product graphs to enable efficient spectral decomposition while preserving high-frequency components. We further provide rigorous over-smoothing and stability analysis under graph perturbations, establishing a solid theoretical foundation. Experimental results on spatiotemporal traffic forecasting illustrate the superiority over the compared methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |

Our approach integrates neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and neural processes into a unified model that captures uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure. We represent dynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent trajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context observations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over latent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and extrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic dynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto oscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK Biobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and disease classification capabilities. The model accurately reconstructs trajectories and extrapolates future cardiac cycles from a single observed cycle. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ACDC classification task (up to 99% accuracy), and detects atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank subjects with competitive performance (up to 67% accuracy). This work introduces a flexible approach for analyzing cardiac motion and offers a foundation for graph-based learning in structured biomedical spatiotemporal time-series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learn from Global Correlations: Enhancing Evolutionary Algorithm via Spectral GNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17629v4)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) simulate natural selection but have two main limitations: (1) they rarely update individuals based on global correlations, limiting comprehensive learning; (2) they struggle with balancing exploration and exploitation, where excessive exploitation causes premature convergence, and excessive exploration slows down the search. Moreover, EAs often depend on manual parameter settings, which can disrupt the exploration-exploitation balance. To address these issues, we propose Graph Neural Evolution (GNE), a novel EA framework. GNE represents the population as a graph, where nodes represent individuals, and edges capture their relationships, enabling global information usage. GNE utilizes spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) to decompose evolutionary signals into frequency components, applying a filtering function to fuse these components. High-frequency components capture diverse global information, while low-frequency ones capture more consistent information. This explicit frequency filtering strategy directly controls global-scale features through frequency components, overcoming the limitations of manual parameter settings and making the exploration-exploitation control more interpretable and manageable. Tests on nine benchmark functions (e.g., Sphere, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock) show that GNE outperforms classical (GA, DE, CMA-ES) and advanced algorithms (SDAES, RL-SHADE) under various conditions, including noise-corrupted and optimal solution deviation scenarios. GNE achieves solutions several orders of magnitude better (e.g., 3.07e-20 mean on Sphere vs. 1.51e-07).</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Explicit Multimodal Graph Modeling for Human-Object Interaction Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12554v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection, which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork \textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs. Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Homophily Booster: Rethinking the Role of Discrete Features on Heterophilic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12530v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, their applications have been limited primarily to small-scale datasets because of memory constraints. While distributed training offers a solution, current frameworks lack support for spatiotemporal models and overlook the properties of spatiotemporal data. Informed by a scaling study on a large-scale workload, we present PyTorch Geometric Temporal Index (PGT-I), an extension to PyTorch Geometric Temporal that integrates distributed data parallel training and two novel strategies: index-batching and distributed-index-batching. Our index techniques exploit spatiotemporal structure to construct snapshots dynamically at runtime, significantly reducing memory overhead, while distributed-index-batching extends this approach by enabling scalable processing across multiple GPUs. Our techniques enable the first-ever training of an ST-GNN on the entire PeMS dataset without graph partitioning, reducing peak memory usage by up to 89% and achieving up to a 11.78x speedup over standard DDP with 128 GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the 2025 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis</p></details> |

Automated detection of MDD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and deep learning (DL) methods holds increasing promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention. Most existing methods employ either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations built from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex brain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision Transformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and Graph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for defining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and functional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are trained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches. Further, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional relationships, and guide GNN-based classification. Extensive experiments were conducted using the REST-meta-MDD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. With stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best model obtained 78.98% accuracy, 76.54% sensitivity, 81.58% specificity, 81.58% precision, and 78.98% F1-score. Further, atlas-based models consistently outperformed the cube-based approach, highlighting the importance of using domain-specific anatomical priors for MDD detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, it remains a prevailing challenge due to the stochastic nature of urban traffic and environmental factors. Better predictions require models capable of accommodating the traffic variability influenced by multiple dynamic and complex interdependent factors. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to address the stochasticity by leveraging adaptive adjacency matrices using log-normal distributions and Coefficient of Variation (CV) values to reflect real-world travel time variability. Additionally, weather factors such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation adjust edge weights and enable GNN to capture evolving spatio-temporal dependencies across traffic stations. This enhancement over the static adjacency matrix allows the model to adapt effectively to traffic stochasticity and changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, we utilize the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP) framework to provide reliable uncertainty quantification, achieving target coverage while maintaining acceptable prediction intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model, in comparison with baseline methods, showed better prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds. We, then, validate this method by constructing traffic scenarios in SUMO and applying Monte-Carlo simulation to derive a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under Test (VUT) to reflect real-world variability. The simulated mean travel time of the VUT falls within the intervals defined by INRIX historical data, verifying the model's robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted as a REGULAR PAPER in the Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems 2025</p></details> |

However, the interplay between GNN parameter optimization, expressivity, and generalization remains poorly understood. We address this by introducing an efficient learnable dimensionality reduction method for visualizing GNN loss landscapes, and by analyzing the effects of over-smoothing, jumping knowledge, quantization, sparsification, and preconditioner on GNN optimization. Our learnable projection method surpasses the state-of-the-art PCA-based approach, enabling accurate reconstruction of high-dimensional parameters with lower memory usage. We further show that architecture, sparsification, and optimizer's preconditioning significantly impact the GNN optimization landscape and their training process and final prediction performance. These insights contribute to developing more efficient designs of GNN architectures and training strategies.</p></details> |  |

Once the ICS is attacked, it may cause serious damage. Therefore, it is very important to detect anomalies in ICSs. ICS can monitor and manage physical devices remotely using communication networks. The existing anomaly detection approaches mainly focus on analyzing the security of network traffic or sensor data. However, the behaviors of different domains (e.g., network traffic and sensor physical status) of ICSs are correlated, so it is difficult to comprehensively identify anomalies by analyzing only a single domain. In this paper, an anomaly detection approach based on cross-domain representation learning in ICSs is proposed, which can learn the joint features of multi-domain behaviors and detect anomalies within different domains. After constructing a cross-domain graph that can represent the behaviors of multiple domains in ICSs, our approach can learn the joint features of them by leveraging graph neural networks. Since anomalies behave differently in different domains, we leverage a multi-task learning approach to identify anomalies in different domains separately and perform joint training. The experimental results show that the performance of our approach is better than existing approaches for identifying anomalies in ICSs.</p></details> |  |

However, enzyme turnover rates remain scarce across most organisms due to the high cost and complexity of experimental measurements. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal framework for predicting the enzyme turnover rate by integrating enzyme sequences, substrate structures, and environmental factors. Our model combines a pre-trained language model and a convolutional neural network to extract features from protein sequences, while a graph neural network captures informative representations from substrate molecules. An attention mechanism is incorporated to enhance interactions between enzyme and substrate representations. Furthermore, we leverage symbolic regression via Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to explicitly learn mathematical formulas that govern the enzyme turnover rate, enabling interpretable and accurate predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. This work provides a robust tool for studying enzyme kinetics and holds promise for applications in enzyme engineering, biotechnology, and industrial biocatalysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures.

These models offer ease of deployment and reliability for most applications, however, they require significant amounts of computational power for training as well as inference. This poses challenges in their adoption in resource-constrained applications, specially in the open-source community where compute availability is usually scarce. This work proposes a graph-based approach for Environmental Claim Detection, exploring Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) as lightweight yet effective alternatives to transformer-based models. Re-framing the task as a graph classification problem, we transform claim sentences into dependency parsing graphs, utilizing a combination of word2vec \& learnable part-of-speech (POS) tag embeddings for the node features and encoding syntactic dependencies in the edge relations. Our results show that our graph-based models, particularly HGNNs in the poincar\'e space (P-HGNNs), achieve performance superior to the state-of-the-art on environmental claim detection while using upto \textbf{30x fewer parameters}. We also demonstrate that HGNNs benefit vastly from explicitly modeling data in hierarchical (tree-like) structures, enabling them to significantly improve over their euclidean counterparts.</p></details> |  |

Modern machine learning has enabled the identification of complex biochemical intricacies in candidate drugs; however, many studies rely on simplified datasets with known drug-disease similarities. We propose a machine learning pipeline that uses unsupervised deep embedded clustering, combined with supervised graph neural network link prediction to identify new drug-disease links from multi-omic data. Unsupervised autoencoder and cluster training reduced the dimensionality of omic data into a compressed latent embedding.

| **[Topology-Aware and Highly Generalizable Deep Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Retrieval in Multi-Deep Storage Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14787v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of multi-deep storage systems. In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in optimizing retrieval tardiness.</p></details> |  |
