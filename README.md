However, satellite time series are voluminous and often corrupted, making them challenging to use. We present TESSERA, an open, global, land-oriented remote sensing foundation model that uses self-supervised learning to generate `ready-to-use' embeddings at 10~m scale from pixel-level satellite time-series data. TESSERA uses two encoders to combine optical data with synthetic aperture radar backscatter coefficients at 10~m resolution to create embeddings that are fused with a multilayer perceptron to create annual global embedding maps. We compare our work with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models in five diverse downstream tasks and find that TESSERA closely matches or outperforms these baselines. We believe that TESSERA's ease of use, state-of-the-art performance, openness, and computation- and labelled data-efficiency will prove transformative in a wide range of ecological applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seeing More with Less: Video Capsule Endoscopy with Multi-Task Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23479v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation by enabling intelligent real-time decision-making, thereby reducing the energy consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a significant advance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves an accuracy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters while surpassing the current baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Applications of Medical AI (AMAI workshop) at MICCAI 2025 (submitted version)</p></details> |
| **[A Collusion-Resistance Privacy-Preserving Smart Metering Protocol for Operational Utility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14744v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern grids have adopted advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to facilitate bidirectional communication between smart meters and control centers. This enables smart meters to report consumption values at predefined intervals to utility providers for purposes including demand balancing, load forecasting, dynamic billing, and operational efficiency. Compared to traditional power grids, smart grids offer advantages such as enhanced reliability, improved energy efficiency, and increased security. However, utility providers can compromise user privacy by analyzing fine-grained readings and extracting individuals' daily activities from this time-series data. To address this concern, we propose a collusion-resistant, privacy-preserving aggregation protocol for smart metering in operational services. Our protocol ensures privacy by leveraging techniques such as partially additive homomorphic encryption, aggregation, data perturbation, and data minimization. The scheme aggregates perturbed readings using the additive homomorphic property of the Paillier cryptosystem to provide results for multiple operational purposes. We evaluate the protocol in terms of both performance and privacy. Computational, memory, and communication overhead were examined. The total execution time with 1024-bit key size is about 2.21 seconds. We also evaluated privacy through the normalized conditional entropy (NCE) metric. Higher NCE values, closer to 1, indicate stronger privacy. By increasing noise scale, the NCE value rises, showing perturbed values retain minimal information about the original, thereby reducing risks. Overall, evaluation demonstrates the protocol's efficiency while employing various privacy-preserving techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[ELATE: Evolutionary Language model for Automated Time-series Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14667v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series prediction involves forecasting future values using machine learning models. Feature engineering, whereby existing features are transformed to make new ones, is critical for enhancing model performance, but is often manual and time-intensive. Existing automation attempts rely on exhaustive enumeration, which can be computationally costly and lacks domain-specific insights. We introduce ELATE (Evolutionary Language model for Automated Time-series Engineering), which leverages a language model within an evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series data. ELATE employs time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics to guide and prune features, while the language model proposes new, contextually relevant feature transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that ELATE improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Simulation of extreme functionals in meteoceanic data: Application to surge evolution over tidal cycles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13687v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the influence of time-varying meteoceanic conditions on coastal flooding under the prism of rare events. Focusing on conditions observed over half tidal cycles, we observe that such data fall within the framework of functional extreme value theory, but violate standard assumptions due to temporal dependence and short-tailed behavior.a To address this, we propose a two-stage methodology. First, we introduce an autoregressive model to eliminate temporal dependence between cycles. Second, considering the model residuals, we adapt existing techniques based on Pareto processes. This allows us to build a simulator of extreme scenarios, by applying inverse transformations. These simulations depend on an initial time series, which can be randomly selected to tune the desired level of extremes. We validate the simulator performance by comparing simulated times series with observations, through several criteria, based on principal component analysis, extreme value analysis, and classification algorithms. The approach is applied to the surge data, on the G{\^a}vres site, located in southern Brittany, France.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Pre-Trained Time Series Models for Electricity Price Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08113v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate electricity price forecasting (EPF) is crucial for effective decision-making in power trading on the spot market. While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have inspired the development of numerous time series foundation models (TSFMs) for time series forecasting, their effectiveness in EPF remains uncertain. To address this gap, we benchmark several state-of-the-art pretrained models--Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-T5, TimesFM, Moirai, Time-MoE, and TimeGPT--against established statistical and machine learning (ML) methods for EPF. Using 2024 day-ahead auction (DAA) electricity prices from Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium, we generate daily forecasts with a one-day horizon. Chronos-Bolt and Time-MoE emerge as the strongest among the TSFMs, performing on par with traditional models. However, the biseasonal MSTL model, which captures daily and weekly seasonality, stands out for its consistent performance across countries and evaluation metrics, with no TSFM statistically outperforming it.</p></details> |  |
| **[Artificial Intelligence-Based Multiscale Temporal Modeling for Anomaly Detection in Cloud Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14503v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision, enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed, covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios, and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision, recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior capability in complex cloud environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Organ-Agents: Virtual Human Physiology Simulator via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14357v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g., cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from 7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops (<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in critical care.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Autoregressive Switching Processes with Cumulative Shrinkage Priors for Graphical Modeling of Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03385v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a flexible Bayesian approach for sparse Gaussian graphical modeling of multivariate time series. We account for temporal correlation in the data by assuming that observations are characterized by an underlying and unobserved hidden discrete autoregressive process. We assume multivariate Gaussian emission distributions and capture spatial dependencies by modeling the state-specific precision matrices via graphical horseshoe priors. We characterize the mixing probabilities of the hidden process via a cumulative shrinkage prior that accommodates zero-inflated parameters for non-active components, and further incorporate a sparsity-inducing Dirichlet prior to estimate the effective number of states from the data. For posterior inference, we develop a sampling procedure that allows estimation of the number of discrete autoregressive lags and the number of states, and that cleverly avoids having to deal with the changing dimensions of the parameter space. We thoroughly investigate performance of our proposed methodology through several simulation studies. We further illustrate the use of our approach for the estimation of dynamic brain connectivity based on fMRI data collected on a subject performing a task-based experiment on latent learning</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Agentic Workflows for Financial Time-Series Modeling with LLMs and Reflective Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13915v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection, code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning, robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that \textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Energy-Aware Time-Series Model Deployment on Embedded FPGAs for Resilient Combined Sewer Overflow Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13905v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, increasingly challenge aging combined sewer systems, raising the risk of untreated wastewater overflow. Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can provide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating uncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have offered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their reliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication outages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that enables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution integrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, compressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution. Moreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for optimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy consumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer data, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical measurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ per inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly less energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE 0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to align model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low energy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general, our work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more resilient combined sewer systems. All code can be found in the GitHub Repository (https://github.com/tianheng-ling/EdgeOverflowForecast).</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, accepted by the 11th IEEE International Smart Cities Conference</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Data Storage and Retrieval for Embodied AI: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13901v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI (EAI) agents continuously interact with the physical world, generating vast, heterogeneous multimodal data streams that traditional management systems are ill-equipped to handle. In this survey, we first systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases, Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than 180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust, high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation of autonomous embodied systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Problems in Learning Multiple Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02181v4)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering of time series is a well-studied problem, with applications ranging from quantitative, personalized models of metabolism obtained from metabolite concentrations to state discrimination in quantum information theory. We consider a variant, where given a set of trajectories and a number of parts, we jointly partition the set of trajectories and learn linear dynamical system (LDS) models for each part, so as to minimize the maximum error across all the models. We present globally convergent methods and EM heuristics, accompanied by promising computational results. The key highlight of this method is that it does not require a predefined hidden state dimension but instead provides an upper bound. Additionally, it offers guidance for determining regularization in the system identification.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSD-TS: Exploring the Potential of Linear State Space Models for Diffusion Models in Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13338v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic time series imputation has been widely applied in real-world scenarios due to its ability for uncertainty estimation and denoising diffusion probabilistic models~(DDPMs) have achieved great success in probabilistic time series imputation tasks with its power to model complex distributions. However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)\textit{The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the dependencies in the time series data effectively.} To address the first challenge, we explore the potential of state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denoising module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for time series data modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple real-world datasets. Our datasets and code are available at \href{https://github.com/decisionintelligence/SSD-TS/}{https://github.com/decisionintelligence/SSD-TS/}</p></details> | KDD' 25 |
| **[On the reconstruction limits of complex networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01437v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network reconstruction consists in retrieving the hidden interaction structure of a system from observations. Many reconstruction algorithms have been proposed, although less research has been devoted to describe their theoretical limitations. In this work, we take a first-principles approach and build on our earlier definition of reconstructability-the fraction of structural information recoverable from data. We relate this quantity to the true data-generating (TDG) process and delineate an information-theoretic reconstruction limit, i.e., the upper bound of the mutual information between the true underlying graph and any graph reconstructed from observations. These concepts lead us to a principled numerical method to assess the validity of empirically reconstructed networks, based on model selection and a quantity we introduce: the reconstruction index. This index approximates the reconstructability from data, quantifies the variability of the reconstructed network ensemble, and is shown to predict reconstruction error without requiring knowledge of the true underlying network. We characterize this method and test it on empirical time series and networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[PENGUIN: Enhancing Transformer with Periodic-Nested Group Attention for Long-term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13773v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a fundamental task with wide-ranging applications. Although Transformer-based models have made significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and Transformer-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowState: Sampling Rate Invariant Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05287v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient. We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model, FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to varying input sampling rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review</p></details> |
| **[ERIS: An Energy-Guided Feature Disentanglement Framework for Out-of-Distribution Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14134v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this, current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\textbf{ERIS}) framework to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that ERIS improves upon state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy across four benchmarks.</p></details> | conference |
| **[HRS: Hybrid Representation Framework with Scheduling Awareness for Time Series Forecasting in Crowdsourced Cloud-Edge Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12839v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid proliferation of streaming services, network load exhibits highly time-varying and bursty behavior, posing serious challenges for maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) in Crowdsourced Cloud-Edge Platforms (CCPs). While CCPs leverage Predict-then-Schedule architecture to improve QoS and profitability, accurate load forecasting remains challenging under traffic surges. Existing methods either minimize mean absolute error, resulting in underprovisioning and potential Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations during peak periods, or adopt conservative overprovisioning strategies, which mitigate SLA risks at the expense of increased resource expenditure. To address this dilemma, we propose HRS, a hybrid representation framework with scheduling awareness that integrates numerical and image-based representations to better capture extreme load dynamics. We further introduce a Scheduling-Aware Loss (SAL) that captures the asymmetric impact of prediction errors, guiding predictions that better support scheduling decisions. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that HRS consistently outperforms ten baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing SLA violation rates by 63.1% and total profit loss by 32.3%.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 14 figures, ECAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing with Visibility Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19046v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of complex and nonlinear time series remains a challenging problem across engineering and scientific disciplines. Reservoir computing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional deep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly structured and fixed reservoir network. Despite its advantages, the largely random reservoir graph architecture often results in suboptimal and oversized networks with poorly understood dynamics. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that systematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input training sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG) technique, which converts time series data into networks by representing measurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network is constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data sequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid expensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is directly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study. We assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical nonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency. Compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) graph of the same size, spectral radius, and fixed density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent performance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG. An ER graph with density matched to the DyRC-VG can in some conditions outperform both approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures.

Accurate demographic forecasting is essential for informed decision-making in areas such as urban planning, healthcare, and economic policy. This study explores the application of time series foundation models to predict demographic changes in the United States using datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau and Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). We evaluate the performance of the Time Series Foundation Model (TimesFM) against traditional baselines including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Linear Regression. Our experiments across six demographically diverse states demonstrate that TimesFM achieves the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) in 86.67% of test cases, with particularly strong performance on minority populations with sparse historical data. These findings highlight the potential of pre-trained foundation models to enhance demographic analysis and inform proactive policy interventions without requiring extensive task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Conditionally specified graphical modeling of stationary multivariate time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13572v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical models are ubiquitous for summarizing conditional relations in multivariate data. In many applications involving multivariate time series, it is of interest to learn an interaction graph that treats each individual time series as nodes of the graph, with the presence of an edge between two nodes signifying conditional dependence given the others. Typically, the partial covariance is used as a measure of conditional dependence. However, in many applications, the outcomes may not be Gaussian and/or could be a mixture of different outcomes. For such time series using the partial covariance as a measure of conditional dependence may be restrictive. In this article, we propose a broad class of time series models which are specifically designed to succinctly encode process-wide conditional independence in its parameters. For each univariate component in the time series, we model its conditional distribution with a distribution from the exponential family. We develop a notion of process-wide compatibility under which such conditional specifications can be stitched together to form a well-defined strictly stationary multivariate time series. We call this construction a conditionally exponential stationary graphical model ({\it CEStGM}). A central quantity underlying CEStGM is a positive kernel which we call the interaction kernel. Spectral properties of such positive kernel operators constitute a core technical foundation of this work. We establish process-wide local and global Markov properties of CEStGM exploiting a Hammersley-Clifford type decomposition of the interaction kernel. Further, we study various probabilistic properties of CEStGM and show that it is geometrically mixing. An approximate Gibbs sampler is also developed to simulate sample paths of CEStGM.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedKGent: A Large Language Model Agent Framework for Constructing Temporally Evolving Medical Knowledge Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12393v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of medical literature presents growing challenges for structuring and integrating domain knowledge at scale. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a promising solution by enabling efficient retrieval, automated reasoning, and knowledge discovery. However, current KG construction methods often rely on supervised pipelines with limited generalizability or naively aggregate outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), treating biomedical corpora as static and ignoring the temporal dynamics and contextual uncertainty of evolving knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce MedKGent, a LLM agent framework for constructing temporally evolving medical KGs. Leveraging over 10 million PubMed abstracts published between 1975 and 2023, we simulate the emergence of biomedical knowledge via a fine-grained daily time series. MedKGent incrementally builds the KG in a day-by-day manner using two specialized agents powered by the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model. The Extractor Agent identifies knowledge triples and assigns confidence scores via sampling-based estimation, which are used to filter low-confidence extractions and inform downstream processing. The Constructor Agent incrementally integrates the retained triples into a temporally evolving graph, guided by confidence scores and timestamps to reinforce recurring knowledge and resolve conflicts. The resulting KG contains 156,275 entities and 2,971,384 relational triples. Quality assessments by two SOTA LLMs and three domain experts demonstrate an accuracy approaching 90%, with strong inter-rater agreement. To evaluate downstream utility, we conduct RAG across seven medical question answering benchmarks using five leading LLMs, consistently observing significant improvements over non-augmented baselines.

| **[Simultaneous inference for monotone and smoothly time-varying functions under complex temporal dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02177v4)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new framework for the simultaneous inference of monotone and smoothly time-varying functions under complex temporal dynamics. This will be done utilizing the monotone rearrangement and the nonparametric estimation. We capitalize the Gaussian approximation for the nonparametric monotone estimator and construct the asymptotically correct simultaneous confidence bands (SCBs) using designed bootstrap methods. We investigate two general and practical scenarios. The first is the simultaneous inference of monotone smooth trends from moderately high-dimensional time series. The proposed algorithm has been employed for the joint inference of temperature curves from multiple areas. Specifically, most existing methods are designed for a single monotone smooth trend. In such cases, our proposed SCB empirically exhibits the narrowest width among existing approaches while maintaining confidence levels. It has also been used for testing several hypotheses tailored to global warming. The second scenario involves simultaneous inference of monotone and smoothly time-varying regression coefficients in time-varying coefficient linear models. The proposed algorithm has been utilized for testing the impact of sunshine duration on temperature which is believed to be increasing due to severe greenhouse effect. The validity of the proposed methods has been justified in theory as well as by extensive simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[DualSG: A Dual-Stream Explicit Semantic-Guided Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21830v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications. Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively, methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs, rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation. Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025 (ACM MM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[EventTSF: Event-Aware Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13434v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality, resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF), an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions. Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Identification and Estimation of Multi-order Tensor Factor Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13418v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework in high-dimensional factor models to simultaneously analyze multiple tensor time series, each with potentially different tensor orders and dimensionality. The connection between different tensor time series is through their global factors that are correlated to each other. A salient feature of our model is that when all tensor time series have the same order, it can be regarded as an extension of multilevel factor models from vectors to general tensors. Under very mild conditions, we separate the global and local components in the proposed model. Parameter estimation is thoroughly discussed. With strong correlation between global factors and noise allowed, we derive the rates of convergence of our estimators, which can be more superior than those of existing methods for multilevel factor models. We also develop estimators that are more computationally efficient, with rates of convergence spelt out. Extensive experiments are performed under various settings, corroborating with the pronounced theoretical results. As a real application example, we analyze a set of taxi data to study the traffic flow between Times Squares and its neighboring areas.</p></details> | 47 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer Using Multimodal Learning on Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06627v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers, and early detection remains a major clinical challenge due to the absence of specific symptoms and reliable biomarkers. In this work, we propose a new multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series, pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new biomarkers.

| **[A Cost-Effective Framework for Predicting Parking Availability Using Geospatial Data and Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14125v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As urban populations continue to grow, cities face numerous challenges in managing parking and determining occupancy. This issue is particularly pronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking spots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability of parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing efficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a smart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps, mobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive days with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require any sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to provide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location services. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to specify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was employed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of Determination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142 and highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an LSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.</p></details> |  |

Efficient data engineering is critical to handle challenges of latency, scalability, and consistency. Modern data lakehouse formats Delta Parquet, Apache Iceberg, and Apache Hudi offer features such as ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and real-time ingestion, combining the strengths of data lakes and warehouses to support complex use cases. This study presents a comparative analysis of Delta Parquet, Iceberg, and Hudi using real-world time-series automotive telemetry data with fields such as vehicle ID, timestamp, location, and event metrics. The evaluation considers modeling strategies, partitioning, CDC support, query performance, scalability, data consistency, and ecosystem maturity. Key findings show Delta Parquet provides strong ML readiness and governance, Iceberg delivers high performance for batch analytics and cloud-native workloads, while Hudi is optimized for real-time ingestion and incremental processing. Each format exhibits tradeoffs in query efficiency, time-travel, and update semantics.

However, existing methods often rely on point estimates or purely data-driven models, which tend to falter under data scarcity. We propose a time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals to serve as structured priors for generative modeling. Our method, ODE-Diff, bridges mechanistic and data-driven approaches, enabling more reliable and interpretable causal inference. We evaluate ODE-Diff across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations, synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and distributional accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Shrinkage in High-Dimensional VAR Models: A Comparative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05489v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional vector autoregressive (VAR) models offer a versatile framework for multivariate time series analysis, yet face critical challenges from over-parameterization and uncertain lag order. In this paper, we systematically compare three Bayesian shrinkage priors (horseshoe, lasso, and normal) and two frequentist regularization approaches (ridge and nonparametric shrinkage) under three carefully crafted simulation scenarios. These scenarios encompass (i) overfitting in a low-dimensional setting, (ii) sparse high-dimensional processes, and (iii) a combined scenario where both large dimension and overfitting complicate inference. We evaluate each method in quality of parameter estimation (root mean squared error, coverage, and interval length) and out-of-sample forecasting (one-step-ahead forecast RMSE). Our findings show that local-global Bayesian methods, particularly the horseshoe, dominate in maintaining accurate coverage and minimizing parameter error, even when the model is heavily over-parameterized. Frequentist ridge often yields competitive point forecasts but underestimates uncertainty, leading to sub-nominal coverage. A real-data application using macroeconomic variables from Canada illustrates how these methods perform in practice, reinforcing the advantages of local-global priors in stabilizing inference when dimension or lag order is inflated.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Explainable AI based approach for Monitoring Animal Health](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10210v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring cattle health and optimizing yield are key challenges faced by dairy farmers due to difficulties in tracking all animals on the farm. This work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data, including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency, Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models for sustainable livestock management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer -- Towards Foundational Digital Twins in Process Industry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13111v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational modelling of multi-dimensional time-series data in industrial systems presents a central trade-off: channel-dependent (CD) models capture specific cross-variable dynamics but lack robustness and adaptability as model layers are commonly bound to the data dimensionality of the tackled use-case, while channel-independent (CI) models offer generality at the cost of modelling the explicit interactions crucial for system-level predictive regression tasks. To resolve this, we propose the Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer (CGPT), a novel architecture that integrates a known causal graph as an inductive bias. The core of CGPT is built around a pairwise modeling paradigm, tackling the CD/CI conflict by decomposing the multidimensional data into pairs. The model uses channel-agnostic learnable layers where all parameter dimensions are independent of the number of variables. CGPT enforces a CD information flow at the pair-level and CI-like generalization across pairs. This approach disentangles complex system dynamics and results in a highly flexible architecture that ensures scalability and any-variate adaptability. We validate CGPT on a suite of synthetic and real-world industrial datasets on long-term and one-step forecasting tasks designed to simulate common industrial complexities. Results demonstrate that CGPT significantly outperforms both CI and CD baselines in predictive accuracy and shows competitive performance with end-to-end trained CD models while remaining agnostic to the problem dimensionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, multivariate time series modeling faces challenges due to data complexity, uncertainty, and frequent regime shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics can introduce biases and limit generalization. This work compares two custom evaluation functions: FMAE (Focused Mean Absolute Error), focused on minimizing absolute errors, and HEF (Hierarchical Evaluation Function), designed to weight global metrics and penalize large deviations. Experiments were conducted under different data splits (91:9, 80:20, 70:30) using three optimizers (Grid Search, PSO, Optuna), assessing fit, relative accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Results show that HEF consistently outperforms FMAE in global metrics (R2, Relative Accuracy, RMSE, RMSSE), enhancing model robustness and explanatory power. These findings were confirmed via visualizations and statistical tests. Conversely, FMAE offers advantages in local metrics (MAE, MASE) and execution time, making it suitable for short-term scenarios. The study highlights a methodological trade-off: HEF is ideal for strategic planning, while FMAE is better suited for operational efficiency. A replicable framework is proposed for optimizing predictive models in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures, 110 tables.

This survey provides a comprehensive examination of spectral methods from classical Fourier analysis to modern neural operators, systematically summarizing three open challenges in current research: (1) causal structure preservation during spectral transformations, (2) uncertainty quantification in learned frequency representations, and (3) topology-aware analysis for non-Euclidean data structures. Through rigorous reviewing of over 100 studies, we develop a unified taxonomy that bridges conventional spectral techniques with cutting-edge machine learning approaches, while establishing standardized benchmarks for performance evaluation. Our work identifies key knowledge gaps in the field, particularly in geometric deep learning and quantum-enhanced spectral analysis.

| **[A self-supervised learning approach for denoising autoregressive models with additive noise: finite and infinite variance cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12970v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The autoregressive time series model is a popular second-order stationary process, modeling a wide range of real phenomena. However, in applications, autoregressive signals are often corrupted by additive noise. Further, the autoregressive process and the corruptive noise may be highly impulsive, stemming from an infinite-variance distribution. The model estimation techniques that account for additional noise tend to show reduced efficacy when there is very strong noise present in the data, especially when the noise is heavy-tailed. Moreover, identification of a model corrupted with heavy-tailed, particularly infinite-variance noise, can be a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning method to denoise the additive noise-corrupted autoregressive model. Our approach is motivated by recent work in computer vision and does not require full knowledge of the noise distribution. We use the proposed method to recover exemplary finite- and infinite-variance autoregressive signals, namely, Gaussian- and alpha-stable distributed signals, respectively, from their noise-corrupted versions. The simulation study conducted on both synthetic and semi-synthetic data demonstrates the efficiency of our method compared to several baseline methods, particularly when the corruption is significant and impulsive in nature. Finally, we apply the presented methodology to forecast the pure autoregressive signal from the noise-corrupted data.</p></details> | 32 pages, 17 figures |

Unlike existing approaches, we do not rely on fixed historical windows and handcrafted features, but rather encode the entire recent possession, thereby avoiding the inclusion of potentially irrelevant or misleading historical information. Path signatures naturally capture the order and interaction of events, providing a mathematically grounded feature encoding for variable-length time series of irregular sampling frequencies without the necessity for manual feature engineering. Our proposed approach outperforms a transformer-based benchmark across various loss metrics and considerably reduces computational cost. Building on these results, we introduce a new possession evaluation metric based on well-established frameworks in soccer analytics, incorporating both predicted action type probabilities and action location. Our metric shows greater reliability than existing metrics in domain-specific comparisons. Finally, we validate our approach through a detailed analysis of the 2017/18 Premier League season and discuss further applications and future extensions.</p></details> |  |

We present a data-driven method for estimating the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) from one-dimensional chaotic time series using machine learning. A predictor is trained to produce out-of-sample, multi-horizon forecasts; the LLE is then inferred from the exponential growth of the geometrically averaged forecast error (GMAE) across the horizon, which serves as a proxy for trajectory divergence. We validate the approach on four canonical 1D maps-logistic, sine, cubic, and Chebyshev-achieving R2pos > 0.99 against reference LLE curves with series as short as M = 450. Among baselines, KNN yields the closest fits (KNN-R comparable; RF larger deviations). By design the estimator targets positive exponents: in periodic/stable regimes it returns values indistinguishable from zero. Noise robustness is assessed by adding zero-mean white measurement noise and summarizing performance versus the average SNR over parameter sweeps: accuracy saturates for SNRm > 30 dB and collapses below 27 dB, a conservative sensor-level benchmark. The method is simple, computationally efficient, and model-agnostic, requiring only stationarity and the presence of a dominant positive exponent. It offers a practical route to LLE estimation in experimental settings where only scalar time-series measurements are available, with extensions to higher-dimensional and irregularly sampled data left for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 2 Tables, 14 Equations</p></details> |

We developed an affective computing platform that enables taking brief data samples while maintaining personalized statistical power. This is achieved by combining a new data type derived from the micropeaks present in time series data registered from brief (5-second-long) face videos with recent advances in AI-driven face-grid estimation methods. By adopting geometric and nonlinear dynamical systems approaches to analyze the kinematics, especially the speed data, the new methods capture all facial micropeaks. These include as well the nuances of different affective micro expressions.

However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation (OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA) hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers, enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF) Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient spatial-temporal modeling.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Not surprisingly, many forecasting methods are being proposed. To ensure progress, it is essential to be able to study and compare such methods empirically in a comprehensive and reliable manner. To achieve this, we propose TFB, an automated benchmark for Time Series Forecasting (TSF) methods. TFB advances the state-of-the-art by addressing shortcomings related to datasets, comparison methods, and evaluation pipelines: 1) insufficient coverage of data domains, 2) stereotype bias against traditional methods, and 3) inconsistent and inflexible pipelines. To achieve better domain coverage, we include datasets from 10 different domains: traffic, electricity, energy, the environment, nature, economic, stock markets, banking, health, and the web. We also provide a time series characterization to ensure that the selected datasets are comprehensive. To remove biases against some methods, we include a diverse range of methods, including statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning methods, and we also support a variety of evaluation strategies and metrics to ensure a more comprehensive evaluations of different methods. To support the integration of different methods into the benchmark and enable fair comparisons, TFB features a flexible and scalable pipeline that eliminates biases. Next, we employ TFB to perform a thorough evaluation of 21 Univariate Time Series Forecasting (UTSF) methods on 8,068 univariate time series and 14 Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) methods on 25 datasets.

When expensive high-dimensional dynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic loss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative, history-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics from time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework using the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by construction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium statistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before specializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable for entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning strategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on benchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1) coarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while preserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed video of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local rearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics. We provide open-source implementations in both PyTorch and LAMMPS, enabling large-scale inference and extensibility to diverse particle-based systems.</p></details> | 34 pages, 12 figures |

A carefully chosen set of identification conditions for the common component and the potentially nonstationary main effects is proposed to strengthen the interpretations of sparse main effects, while estimators of all model components are presented. Sparse estimation of the latent main effects is proposed using a doubly adaptive fused lasso estimation to allow for sparse sub-block detection, with theoretical guarantees and rates of convergence spelt out for the final estimators. Sparse block consistency for the main effects is also proved as a result. A realized Mallow's $C_p$ is developed for tuning parameter selection, with practical implementation described. Simulation experiments are performed under a variety of settings, showing our proposed estimators work well.

| **[Bi-Axial Transformers: Addressing the Increasing Complexity of EHR Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12418v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic Health Records (EHRs), the digital representation of a patient's medical history, are a valuable resource for epidemiological and clinical research. They are also becoming increasingly complex, with recent trends indicating larger datasets, longer time series, and multi-modal integrations. Transformers, which have rapidly gained popularity due to their success in natural language processing and other domains, are well-suited to address these challenges due to their ability to model long-range dependencies and process data in parallel. But their application to EHR classification remains limited by data representations, which can reduce performance or fail to capture informative missingness. In this paper, we present the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), which attends to both the clinical variable and time point axes of EHR data to learn richer data relationships and address the difficulties of data sparsity. BAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on sepsis prediction and is competitive to top methods for mortality classification. In comparison to other transformers, BAT demonstrates increased robustness to data missingness, and learns unique sensor embeddings which can be used in transfer learning. Baseline models, which were previously located across multiple repositories or utilized deprecated libraries, were re-implemented with PyTorch and made available for reproduction and future benchmarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Interpreting Time Series Forecasts with LIME and SHAP: A Case Study on the Air Passengers Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12253v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting underpins critical decisions across aviation, energy, retail and health. Classical autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models offer interpretability via coefficients but struggle with nonlinearities, whereas tree-based machine-learning models such as XGBoost deliver high accuracy but are often opaque. This paper presents a unified framework for interpreting time-series forecasts using local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and SHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP). We convert a univariate series into a leakage-free supervised learning problem, train a gradient-boosted tree alongside an ARIMA baseline and apply post-hoc explainability. Using the Air Passengers dataset as a case study, we show that a small set of lagged features -- particularly the twelve-month lag -- and seasonal encodings explain most forecast variance. We contribute: (i) a methodology for applying LIME and SHAP to time series without violating chronology; (ii) theoretical exposition of the underlying algorithms; (iii) empirical evaluation with extensive analysis; and (iv) guidelines for practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[STM3: Mixture of Multiscale Mamba for Long-Term Spatio-Temporal Time-Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12247v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, spatio-temporal time-series prediction has developed rapidly, yet existing deep learning methods struggle with learning complex long-term spatio-temporal dependencies efficiently. The long-term spatio-temporal dependency learning brings two new challenges: 1) The long-term temporal sequence includes multiscale information naturally which is hard to extract efficiently; 2) The multiscale temporal information from different nodes is highly correlated and hard to model. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM2) that includes a multiscale Mamba architecture to capture the multiscale information efficiently and simultaneously, and an adaptive graph causal convolution network to learn the complex multiscale spatio-temporal dependency. STM2 includes hierarchical information aggregation for different-scale information that guarantees their distinguishability. To capture diverse temporal dynamics across all spatial nodes more efficiently, we further propose an enhanced version termed \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ixture of \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM3) that employs a special Mixture-of-Experts architecture, including a more stable routing strategy and a causal contrastive learning strategy to enhance the scale distinguishability. We prove that STM3 has much better routing smoothness and guarantees the pattern disentanglement for each expert successfully. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate STM2/STM3's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in long-term spatio-temporal time-series prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedSpaformer: a Transferable Transformer with Multi-granularity Token Sparsification for Medical Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15578v3)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate medical time series (MedTS) classification is essential for effective clinical diagnosis, yet remains challenging due to complex multi-channel temporal dependencies, information redundancy, and label scarcity. While transformer-based models have shown promise in time series analysis, most are designed for forecasting tasks and fail to fully exploit the unique characteristics of MedTS. In this paper, we introduce MedSpaformer, a transformer-based framework tailored for MedTS classification. It incorporates a sparse token-based dual-attention mechanism that enables global context modeling and token sparsification, allowing dynamic feature refinement by focusing on informative tokens while reducing redundancy. This mechanism is integrated into a multi-granularity cross-channel encoding scheme to capture intra- and inter-granularity temporal dependencies and inter-channel correlations, enabling progressive refinement of task-relevant patterns in medical signals. The sparsification design allows our model to flexibly accommodate inputs with variable lengths and channel dimensions. We also introduce an adaptive label encoder to extract label semantics and address cross-dataset label space misalignment. Together, these components enhance the model's transferability across heterogeneous medical datasets, which helps alleviate the challenge of label scarcity. Our model outperforms 13 baselines across 7 medical datasets under supervised learning. It also excels in few-shot learning and demonstrates zero-shot capability in both in-domain and cross-domain diagnostics. These results highlight MedSpaformer's robustness and its potential as a unified solution for MedTS classification across diverse settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 fig...</summary><p>4 figures, 9 pages, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, current PLM-based TSF methods still fail to achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy matching the strong sequential modeling power of language models. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Model and Cross-Modality Learning with PLMs for time series forecasting (CC-Time). We explore the potential of PLMs for time series forecasting from two aspects: 1) what time series features could be modeled by PLMs, and 2) whether relying solely on PLMs is sufficient for building time series models. In the first aspect, CC-Time incorporates cross-modality learning to model temporal dependency and channel correlations in the language model from both time series sequences and their corresponding text descriptions. In the second aspect, CC-Time further proposes the cross-model fusion block to adaptively integrate knowledge from the PLMs and time series model to form a more comprehensive modeling of time series patterns. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that CC-Time achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in both full-data training and few-shot learning situations.</p></details> |  |

PanelMatch is an R package that implements a set of tools enabling researchers to apply matching methods for causal inference with time-series cross-sectional data. Relative to other commonly used methods for longitudinal analyses, like regression with fixed effects, the matching-based approach implemented in PanelMatch makes fewer parametric assumptions and offers more diagnostics. In this paper, we discuss the PanelMatch package, showing users a recommended pipeline for doing causal inference analysis with it and highlighting useful diagnostic and visualization tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Gaussian Processes with Latent Kronecker Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06895v2)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applying Gaussian processes (GPs) to very large datasets remains a challenge due to limited computational scalability. Matrix structures, such as the Kronecker product, can accelerate operations significantly, but their application commonly entails approximations or unrealistic assumptions. In particular, the most common path to creating a Kronecker-structured kernel matrix is by evaluating a product kernel on gridded inputs that can be expressed as a Cartesian product. However, this structure is lost if any observation is missing, breaking the Cartesian product structure, which frequently occurs in real-world data such as time series. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging latent Kronecker structure, by expressing the kernel matrix of observed values as the projection of a latent Kronecker product. In combination with iterative linear system solvers and pathwise conditioning, our method facilitates inference of exact GPs while requiring substantially fewer computational resources than standard iterative methods. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art sparse and variational GPs on real-world datasets with up to five million examples, including robotics, automated machine learning, and climate applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Machine Learning 2025</p></details> |

Sufficient conditions for asymptotic equicontinuity are provided for nonstationary arrays of time series. This yields comprehensive general results that are applicable to various notions of dependence, which is exemplified in detail for nonstationary $\alpha$-mixing series. Especially, we obtain the weak convergence of the sequential process under essentially the same mild assumptions as known for the classical empirical process. Core ingredients of the proofs are a novel maximal inequality for nonmeasurable stochastic processes, uniform chaining arguments and, for the set-indexed smoothed process, uniform Lipschitz properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniCast: A Unified Multimodal Prompting Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11954v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is a foundational task across domains, such as finance, healthcare, and environmental monitoring. While recent advances in Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated strong generalisation through large-scale pretraining, existing models operate predominantly in a unimodal setting, ignoring the rich multimodal context, such as visual and textual signals, that often accompanies time series data in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel parameter-efficient multimodal framework, UniCast, that extends TSFMs to jointly leverage time series, vision, and text modalities for enhanced forecasting performance. Our method integrates modality-specific embeddings from pretrained Vision and Text Encoders with a frozen TSFM via soft prompt tuning, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal parameter updates. This design not only preserves the generalisation strength of the foundation model but also enables effective cross-modal interaction. Extensive experiments across diverse time-series forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that UniCast consistently and significantly outperforms all existing TSFM baselines. The findings highlight the critical role of multimodal context in advancing the next generation of general-purpose time series forecasters.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Wavelet-Based Framework for Mapping Long Memory in Resting-State fMRI: Age-Related Changes in the Hippocampus from the ADHD-200 Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11920v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series are known to exhibit long-range temporal dependencies that challenge traditional modeling approaches. In this study, we propose a novel computational pipeline to characterize and interpret these dependencies using a long-memory (LM) framework, which captures the slow, power-law decay of autocorrelation in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) signals. The pipeline involves voxelwise estimation of LM parameters via a wavelet-based Bayesian method, yielding spatial maps that reflect temporal dependence across the brain. These maps are then projected onto a lower-dimensional space via a composite basis and are then related to individual-level covariates through group-level regression. We applied this approach to the ADHD-200 dataset and found significant positive associations between age in children and the LM parameter in the hippocampus, after adjusting for ADHD symptom severity and medication status. These findings complement prior neuroimaging work by linking long-range temporal dependence to developmental changes in memory-related brain regions. Overall, the proposed methodology enables detailed mapping of intrinsic temporal dynamics in rs-fMRI and offers new insights into the relationship between functional signal memory and brain development.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeSenCLIP: A Vision-Language Model for Remote Sensing Using Single-Pixel Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11919v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models have shown significant promise in remote sensing applications, particularly for land-use and land-cover (LULC) via zero-shot classification and retrieval. However, current approaches face two key challenges: reliance on large spatial tiles that increase computational cost, and dependence on text-based supervision, which is often not readily available. In this work, we present TimeSenCLIP, a lightweight framework that reevaluate the role of spatial context by evaluating the effectiveness of a single pixel by leveraging its temporal and spectral dimensions, for classifying LULC and ecosystem types. By leveraging spectral and temporal information from Sentinel-2 imagery and cross-view learning with geo-tagged ground-level photos, we minimises the need for caption-based training while preserving semantic alignment between overhead (satellite) and ground perspectives. Our approach is grounded in the LUCAS and Sen4Map datasets, and evaluated on classification tasks including LULC, crop type, and ecosystem type. We demonstrate that single pixel inputs, when combined with temporal and spectral cues, are sufficient for thematic mapping, offering a scalable and efficient alternative for large-scale remote sensing applications.

| **[Physics-Informed Diffusion Models for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11528v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a physics-informed diffusion model for multivariate time series data. Over the past years, diffusion model has demonstrated its effectiveness in forecasting, imputation, generation, and anomaly detection in the time series domain. In this paper, we present a new approach for learning the physics-dependent temporal distribution of multivariate time series data using a weighted physics-informed loss during diffusion model training. A weighted physics-informed loss is constructed using a static weight schedule. This approach enables a diffusion model to accurately approximate underlying data distribution, which can influence the unsupervised anomaly detection performance. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that physics-informed training improves the F1 score in anomaly detection; it generates better data diversity and log-likelihood. Our model outperforms baseline approaches, additionally, it surpasses prior physics-informed work and purely data-driven diffusion models on a synthetic dataset and one real-world dataset while remaining competitive on others.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[BRIEF: BRain-Inspired network connection search with Extensive temporal feature Fusion enhances disease classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11732v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing deep learning models for functional MRI-based classification have limitations in network architecture determination (relying on experience) and feature space fusion (mostly simple concatenation, lacking mutual learning). Inspired by the human brain's mechanism of updating neural connections through learning and decision-making, we proposed a novel BRain-Inspired feature Fusion (BRIEF) framework, which is able to optimize network architecture automatically by incorporating an improved neural network connection search (NCS) strategy and a Transformer-based multi-feature fusion module. Specifically, we first extracted 4 types of fMRI temporal representations, i.e., time series (TCs), static/dynamic functional connection (FNC/dFNC), and multi-scale dispersion entropy (MsDE), to construct four encoders. Within each encoder, we employed a modified Q-learning to dynamically optimize the NCS to extract high-level feature vectors, where the NCS is formulated as a Markov Decision Process. Then, all feature vectors were fused via a Transformer, leveraging both stable/time-varying connections and multi-scale dependencies across different brain regions to achieve the final classification. Additionally, an attention module was embedded to improve interpretability. The classification performance of our proposed BRIEF was compared with 21 state-of-the-art models by discriminating two mental disorders from healthy controls: schizophrenia (SZ, n=1100) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n=1550). BRIEF demonstrated significant improvements of 2.2% to 12.1% compared to 21 algorithms, reaching an AUC of 91.5% - 0.6% for SZ and 78.4% - 0.5% for ASD, respectively. This is the first attempt to incorporate a brain-inspired, reinforcement learning strategy to optimize fMRI-based mental disorder classification, showing significant potential for identifying precise neuroimaging biomarkers.</p></details> |  |

We here introduce infomeasure, an open-source Python package designed to provide robust tools for calculating a wide variety of information-theoretic measures, including entropies, mutual information, transfer entropy and divergences. It is designed for both discrete and continuous variables; implements state-of-the-art estimation techniques; and allows the calculation of local measure values, $p$-values and $t$-scores. By unifying these approaches under one consistent framework, infomeasure aims to mitigate common pitfalls, ensure reproducibility, and simplify the practical implementation of information-theoretic analyses. In this contribution, we explore the motivation and features of infomeasure; its validation, using known analytical solutions; and exemplify its utility in a case study involving the analysis of human brain time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, for documentation, see https://infomeasure.readthedocs.io/</p></details> |
| **[Factor Models of Matrix-Valued Time Series: Nonstationarity and Cointegration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11358v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider the nonstationary matrix-valued time series with common stochastic trends. Unlike the traditional factor analysis which flattens matrix observations into vectors, we adopt a matrix factor model in order to fully explore the intrinsic matrix structure in the data, allowing interaction between the row and column stochastic trends, and subsequently improving the estimation convergence. It also reduces the computation complexity in estimation. The main estimation methodology is built on the eigenanalysis of sample row and column covariance matrices when the nonstationary matrix factors are of full rank and the idiosyncratic components are temporally stationary, and is further extended to tackle a more flexible setting when the matrix factors are cointegrated and the idiosyncratic components may be nonstationary. Under some mild conditions which allow the existence of weak factors, we derive the convergence theory for the estimated factor loading matrices and nonstationary factor matrices. In particular, the developed methodology and theory are applicable to the general case of heterogeneous strengths over weak factors. An easy-to-implement ratio criterion is adopted to consistently estimate the size of latent factor matrix. Both simulation and empirical studies are conducted to examine the numerical performance of the developed model and methodology in finite samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Global Dataset of Location Data Integrity-Assessed Reforestation Efforts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11349v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Afforestation and reforestation are popular strategies for mitigating climate change by enhancing carbon sequestration. However, the effectiveness of these efforts is often self-reported by project developers, or certified through processes with limited external validation. This leads to concerns about data reliability and project integrity. In response to increasing scrutiny of voluntary carbon markets, this study presents a dataset on global afforestation and reforestation efforts compiled from primary (meta-)information and augmented with time-series satellite imagery and other secondary data. Our dataset covers 1,289,068 planting sites from 45,628 projects spanning 33 years. Since any remote sensing-based validation effort relies on the integrity of a planting site's geographic boundary, this dataset introduces a standardized assessment of the provided site-level location information, which we summarize in one easy-to-communicate key indicator: LDIS -- the Location Data Integrity Score. We find that approximately 79\% of the georeferenced planting sites monitored fail on at least 1 out of 10 LDIS indicators, while 15\% of the monitored projects lack machine-readable georeferenced data in the first place. In addition to enhancing accountability in the voluntary carbon market, the presented dataset also holds value as training data for e.g. computer vision-related tasks with millions of linked Sentinel-2 and Planetscope satellite images.</p></details> | 10 figures |
| **[TimeMKG: Knowledge-Infused Causal Reasoning for Multivariate Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09630v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series data typically comprises two distinct modalities: variable semantics and sampled numerical observations. Traditional time series models treat variables as anonymous statistical signals, overlooking the rich semantic information embedded in variable names and data descriptions. However, these textual descriptors often encode critical domain knowledge that is essential for robust and interpretable modeling. Here we present TimeMKG, a multimodal causal reasoning framework that elevates time series modeling from low-level signal processing to knowledge informed inference. TimeMKG employs large language models to interpret variable semantics and constructs structured Multivariate Knowledge Graphs that capture inter-variable relationships. A dual-modality encoder separately models the semantic prompts, generated from knowledge graph triplets, and the statistical patterns from historical time series. Cross-modality attention aligns and fuses these representations at the variable level, injecting causal priors into downstream tasks such as forecasting and classification, providing explicit and interpretable priors to guide model reasoning. The experiment in diverse datasets demonstrates that incorporating variable-level knowledge significantly improves both predictive performance and generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Air Quality PM2.5 Index Prediction Model Based on CNN-LSTM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11215v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the intensification of global climate change, accurate prediction of air quality indicators, especially PM2.5 concentration, has become increasingly important in fields such as environmental protection, public health, and urban management. To address this, we propose an air quality PM2.5 index prediction model based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture. The model effectively combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for local spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for modeling temporal dependencies in time series data. Using a multivariate dataset collected from an industrial area in Beijing between 2010 and 2015 -- which includes hourly records of PM2.5 concentration, temperature, dew point, pressure, wind direction, wind speed, and precipitation -- the model predicts the average PM2.5 concentration over 6-hour intervals. Experimental results show that the model achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.236, outperforming traditional time series models in both accuracy and generalization. This demonstrates its strong potential in real-world applications such as air pollution early warning systems. However, due to the complexity of multivariate inputs, the model demands high computational resources, and its ability to handle diverse atmospheric factors still requires optimization. Future work will focus on enhancing scalability and expanding support for more complex multivariate weather prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |

This setting occurs in time series applications where responses depend on contemporaneous or past explanatory variables and persistent stochastic shocks, including financial modeling, hydrological forecasting, and meteorological applications requiring temporal dependency capture. Our methodology uses hierarchical Bayesian models with spike-and-slab priors to simultaneously select relevant covariates and lagged error terms. We propose an efficient two-stage MCMC algorithm separating sampling of variable inclusion indicators and model parameters to address high-dimensional computational challenges. Theoretical analysis establishes posterior selection consistency under mild conditions, even when candidate predictors grow exponentially with sample size, common in modern time series with many potential lagged variables. Through simulations and real applications (groundwater depth prediction, S&P 500 log returns modeling), we demonstrate substantial gains in variable selection accuracy and predictive performance. Compared to existing methods, our framework achieves lower MSPE, improved true model component identification, and greater robustness with autocorrelated noise, underscoring practical utility for model interpretation and forecasting in autoregressive settings.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate a QRC framework based on two coupled Kerr nonlinear oscillators, a system well-suited for time-series prediction tasks due to its complex nonlinear interactions and potentially high-dimensional state space. We explore how its performance in time-series prediction depends on key physical parameters: input drive strength, Kerr nonlinearity, and oscillator coupling, and analyze the role of entanglement in improving the reservoir's computational performance, focusing on its effect on predicting non-trivial time series. Using logarithmic negativity to quantify entanglement and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) to evaluate predictive accuracy, our results suggest that entanglement provides a computational advantage on average-up to a threshold in the input frequency-that persists under some levels of dissipation and dephasing. In particular, we find that higher dissipation rates can enhance performance. While the entanglement advantage manifests as improvements in both average and worst-case performance, it does not lead to improvements in the best-case error. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of quantum reservoirs for high performance, efficient quantum machine learning and time-series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, when applied to large-scale, spatiotemporally chaotic systems, purely data-driven machine learning methods often suffer from inefficiencies, as they require a large learning model size and a massive amount of training data to achieve acceptable performance. To address this challenge, we incorporate the spatial coupling structure of the target system as an inductive bias in the network design. Specifically, we introduce physics-guided clustered echo state networks, leveraging the efficiency of the echo state networks as a base model. Experimental results on benchmark chaotic systems demonstrate that our physics-informed method outperforms existing echo state network models in learning the target chaotic systems. Additionally, we numerically demonstrate that leveraging coupling knowledge into ESN models can enhance their robustness to variations of training and target system conditions. We further show that our proposed model remains effective even when the coupling knowledge is imperfect or extracted directly from time series data. We believe this approach has the potential to enhance other machine-learning methods.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |

We show that early bed-exit intent can be predicted using only one low-cost load cell mounted under a bed leg. The resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps-recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field-that expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights. To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC. The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time, privacy-preserving fall prevention.</p></details> |  |

Understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial for precise future prediction. While deep learning has achieved major success in time series forecasting, many existing approaches do not explicitly model the dynamics. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepEDM, a framework that integrates nonlinear dynamical systems modeling with deep neural networks. Inspired by empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) and rooted in Takens' theorem, DeepEDM presents a novel deep model that learns a latent space from time-delayed embeddings, and employs kernel regression to approximate the underlying dynamics, while leveraging efficient implementation of softmax attention and allowing for accurate prediction of future time steps. To evaluate our method, we conduct comprehensive experiments on synthetic data of nonlinear dynamical systems as well as real-world time series across domains. Our results show that DeepEDM is robust to input noise, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting accuracy.

Here we propose a regression model that allows for a representation of periodic and dynamic patterns observed in time series data. The model incorporates a hidden strictly positive stochastic process that represents the instantaneous frequency, allowing the model to adapt and accurately capture varying time scales. A case study focusing on age estimation of narwhal tusks is presented, where cyclic element signals associated with annual growth layer groups are analyzed. We apply the methodology to data from one such tusk collected in West Greenland and use the fitted model to estimate the age of the narwhal. The proposed method is validated using simulated signals with known cycle counts and practical considerations and modelling challenges are discussed in detail. This research contributes to the field of time series analysis, providing a tool and valuable insights for understanding and modeling complex cyclic patterns in diverse domains.</p></details> |  |

The influence of various parameter selections and their value adjustments, as well as architectural changes made to an Echo State Network, a powerful recurrent neural network configured as a reservoir computer, can be challenging to fully comprehend without experience in the field, and even some hyperparameter optimization algorithms may have difficulty adjusting parameter values without proper manual selections made first. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the effects of parameters and their value selection on Echo State Network architecture performance for a successful build. Thus, to address the requirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as well as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to variations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a series of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time series classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on the performance of Echo State Network.</p></details> | 49 pages, 21 figures |

While this assumption holds asymptotically for stationary autoregressive processes of order 1 (AR(1)) and simple moving average (SMA) processes when sampling over an increasingly long period, it often fails for finite-length time series. In such cases, the empirical distribution of the Mann-Kendall tau deviates significantly from the Gaussian distribution. To assess the validity of this assumption, we explore an alternative asymptotic framework for AR(1) and SMA processes. We prove that, along upsampling sequences, the distribution of the normalized Mann-Kendall tau does not converge to a Gaussian but instead to a bounded distribution with strictly positive variance. This asymptotic behavior suggests scaling laws which determine the conditions under which the Gaussian approximation remains valid for finite-length time series generated by stationary AR(1) and SMA processes. Using Shapiro-Wilk tests, we numerically confirm the departure from normality and establish simple, practical criteria for assessing the validity of the Gaussian assumption, which depend on both the autocorrelation structure and the series length. Finally, we illustrate these findings with examples from existing studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages including appendices, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Our prior work, TransFed, introduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a learn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers per client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain settings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the investigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a refined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to personalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on adaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional modalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an efficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead via low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse datasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our findings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based federated systems.

Furthermore, allowing temporal variation in the skewness parameter can bring significant gains in the analysis of this type of series. However, for more robustness, it is crucial to develop models that balance flexibility and parsimony. In this paper, we propose dynamic skewness stochastic volatility models in the SMSN family (DynSSV-SMSN), using priors that penalize model complexity. Parameter estimation was carried out using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method via the \texttt{RStan} package. Simulation results demonstrated that penalizing priors present superior performance in several scenarios compared to the classical choices. In the empirical application to returns of cryptocurrencies, models with heavy tails and dynamic skewness provided a better fit to the data according to the DIC, WAIC, and LOO-CV information criteria.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages and 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Goal-Oriented Time-Series Forecasting: Foundation Framework Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17493v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional time-series forecasting methods typically aim to minimize overall prediction error, without accounting for the varying importance of different forecast ranges in downstream applications. We propose a training methodology that enables forecasting models to adapt their focus to application-specific regions of interest at inference time, without retraining. The approach partitions the prediction space into fine-grained segments during training, which are dynamically reweighted and aggregated to emphasize the target range specified by the application. Unlike prior methods that predefine these ranges, our framework supports flexible, on-demand adjustments. Experiments on standard benchmarks and a newly collected wireless communication dataset demonstrate that our method not only improves forecast accuracy within regions of interest but also yields measurable gains in downstream task performance. These results highlight the potential for closer integration between predictive modeling and decision-making in real-world systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Temporal Super-Resolution of Energy Data using Generative Adversarial Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10587v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue, this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application scenario is improved by 13%.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Language Overrules: Revealing Text Dominance in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10552v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a diverse range of multimodal tasks. However, these models suffer from a core problem known as text dominance: they depend heavily on text for their inference, while underutilizing other modalities. While prior work has acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it to data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities, including images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this imbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index (MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis reveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested modalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention dilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence of fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor textual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that effectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for instance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of 0.86. Our analysis and methodological framework offer a foundation for the development of more equitable and comprehensive multimodal language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Maximum Entropy Models for Unimodal Time Series: Case Studies of Universe 25 and St. Matthew Island](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10518v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a maximum entropy modeling framework for unimodal time series: signals that begin at a reference level, rise to a single peak, and return. Such patterns are commonly observed in ecological collapse, population dynamics, and resource depletion. Traditional dynamical models are often inapplicable in these settings due to limited or sparse data, frequently consisting of only a single historical trajectory. In addition, standard fitting approaches can introduce structural bias, particularly near the mode, where most interpretive focus lies. Using the maximum entropy principle, we derive a least-biased functional form constrained only by minimal prior knowledge, such as the starting point and estimated end. This leads to analytically tractable and interpretable models. We apply this method to the collapse of the Universe 25 mouse population and the reindeer crash on St. Matthew Island. These case studies demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of the approach in fitting diverse unimodal time series with minimal assumptions. We also conduct a cross-comparison against established models, including the Richards, Skewnormal, and Generalized Gamma functions. While models typically fit their own generated data best, the maximum entropy models consistently achieve the lowest off-diagonal root-mean-square losses, indicating superior generalization. These results suggest that maximum entropy methods provide a unifying and efficient alternative to mechanistic models when data is limited and generalization is essential.</p></details> | <details><summary>Non p...</summary><p>Non peer-reviewed preprint.

| **[Semantic-Enhanced Time-Series Forecasting via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07697v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a significant role in finance, energy, meteorology, and IoT applications. Recent studies have leveraged the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time series forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies focus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic modality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data patterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent periodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the semantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the interpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs for temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel at capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term anomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded within self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to effectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM and reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing computational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance of our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> | 14 pages,9 figures |

Effectively segmenting and integrating states across these different granularities is crucial for tasks like predictive maintenance and performance optimization. However, existing time series segmentation methods face two key challenges: (1) the inability to handle multiple levels of granularity within a unified model, and (2) limited adaptability to new, evolving patterns in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose PromptTSS, a novel framework for time series segmentation with multi-granularity states. PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages label and boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and fine-grained patterns while adapting dynamically to unseen patterns. Experiments show PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity segmentation, 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in transfer learning, demonstrating its adaptability to hierarchical states and evolving time series dynamics.

| **[Spatio-Temporal Autoregressions for High Dimensional Matrix-Valued Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10291v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by predicting intraday trading volume curves, we consider two spatio-temporal autoregressive models for matrix time series, in which each column may represent daily trading volume curve of one asset, and each row captures synchronized 5-minute volume intervals across multiple assets. While traditional matrix time series focus mainly on temporal evolution, our approach incorporates both spatial and temporal dynamics, enabling simultaneous analysis of interactions across multiple dimensions. The inherent endogeneity in spatio-temporal autoregressive models renders ordinary least squares estimation inconsistent. To overcome this difficulty while simultaneously estimating two distinct weight matrices with banded structure, we develop an iterated generalized Yule-Walker estimator by adapting a generalized method of moments framework based on Yule-Walker equations. Moreover, unlike conventional models that employ a single bandwidth parameter, the dual-bandwidth specification in our framework requires a new two-step, ratio-based sequential estimation procedure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Time Series Generation on Feature and Temporally Misaligned Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21072v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed time series data presents a challenge for federated learning, as clients often possess different feature sets and have misaligned time steps. Existing federated time series models are limited by the assumption of perfect temporal or feature alignment across clients. In this paper, we propose FedTDD, a novel federated time series diffusion model that jointly learns a synthesizer across clients. At the core of FedTDD is a novel data distillation and aggregation framework that reconciles the differences between clients by imputing the misaligned timesteps and features. In contrast to traditional federated learning, FedTDD learns the correlation across clients' time series through the exchange of local synthetic outputs instead of model parameters. A coordinator iteratively improves a global distiller network by leveraging shared knowledge from clients through the exchange of synthetic data. As the distiller becomes more refined over time, it subsequently enhances the quality of the clients' local feature estimates, allowing each client to then improve its local imputations for missing data using the latest, more accurate distiller. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate FedTDD's effectiveness compared to centralized training, and the effectiveness of sharing synthetic outputs to transfer knowledge of local time series. Notably, FedTDD achieves 79.4% and 62.8% improvement over local training in Context-FID and Correlational scores.</p></details> |  |

While general-purpose deep research agents have shown impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored for medical contexts.We present a medical deep research agent that addresses these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool interactions.Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02085v4)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/JARVIS-Xs/SE-Agent.</p></details> |  |

A custom simulation incorporating realistic waves and current disturbances is developed to validate the controller's performance, supported by further validation through field tests in the harbour of Scheveningen, the Netherlands, and at sea. Simulation results demonstrate that ADRC significantly reduces cross-track error across all tested conditions compared to a baseline PID controller but increases control effort and energy consumption. Field trials confirm these findings while revealing a further increase in energy consumption during sea trials compared to the baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at IROS 2025.

To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided hierarchical planning framework for robust spatial-temporal obstacle avoidance. In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance and fast parallel computation. Furthermore, an incremental multi-branch trajectory management framework is introduced to enable spatio-temporal topological decision-making, while efficiently leveraging historical information to reduce replanning time. Simulation results show that TRUST-Planner outperforms baseline competitors, achieving a 96\% success rate and millisecond-level computation efficiency in tested complex environments. Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Even though most traffic accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention, as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions -- and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlightPatchNet: Multi-Scale Patch Network with Differential Coding for Flight Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16200v3)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate multi-step flight trajectory prediction plays an important role in Air Traffic Control, which can ensure the safety of air transportation. Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and most existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by UAI 2025.

The objective is to assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the reliability of the approaches. While previous VTP models overlook the specific traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be guaranteed. These findings can inform the development of more reliable vessel trajectory prediction approaches, enhancing safety and efficiency in future inland waterways navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Tracking and Stabilization of Quadrotors Using Deep Koopman Model Predictive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13795v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a data-driven control framework for quadrotor systems that integrates a deep Koopman operator with model predictive control (DK-MPC). The deep Koopman operator is trained on sampled flight data to construct a high-dimensional latent representation in which the nonlinear quadrotor dynamics are approximated by linear models. This linearization enables the application of MPC to efficiently optimize control actions over a finite prediction horizon, ensuring accurate trajectory tracking and stabilization. The proposed DK-MPC approach is validated through a series of trajectory-following and point-stabilization numerical experiments, where it demonstrates superior tracking accuracy and significantly lower computation time compared to conventional nonlinear MPC. These results highlight the potential of Koopman-based learning methods to handle complex quadrotor dynamics while meeting the real-time requirements of embedded flight control. Future work will focus on extending the framework to more agile flight scenarios and improving robustness against external disturbances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Machine Learning Model with a Constrained Action Space for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03666v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial to advance autonomous driving, improving safety, and efficiency. Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world Argoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark comparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2025 IEEE.

| **[Rapid Urban Visibility Hotspots: Quantifying Building Vertex Visibility from Connected Vehicle Trajectories using Spatial Indexing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03365v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective placement of Out-of-Home advertising and street furniture requires accurate identification of locations offering maximum visual exposure to target audiences, particularly vehicular traffic. Traditional site selection methods often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity) radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings: 1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots' receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2) The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Tube Visualization of Particle Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13505v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel, computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROVER: Robust Loop Closure Verification with Trajectory Prior in Repetitive Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13488v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes, achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity. Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter, we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

| **[Adaptive Conformal Prediction Intervals Over Trajectory Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13362v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. By introducing a novel online update step and an optimization step that captures inter-step dependencies, our method can produce discontinuous prediction intervals around each trajectory, naturally capture temporal dependencies, and yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRAP: Robot Sub-Trajectory Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15182v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning is witnessing a significant increase in the size, diversity, and complexity of pre-collected datasets, mirroring trends in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Many robot learning methods treat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task, generalist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the "sub"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve sub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion. STRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning methods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much larger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn robust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at https://weirdlabuw.github.io/strap/</p></details> |

We study generative modeling for planning with datasets repurposed from offline reinforcement learning. Specifically, we identify temporal consistency in the absence of step-wise rewards as one key technical challenge. We introduce the Latent Plan Transformer (LPT), a novel model that leverages a latent variable to connect a Transformer-based trajectory generator and the final return. LPT can be learned with maximum likelihood estimation on trajectory-return pairs. In learning, posterior sampling of the latent variable naturally integrates sub-trajectories to form a consistent abstraction despite the finite context. At test time, the latent variable is inferred from an expected return before policy execution, realizing the idea of planning as inference. Our experiments demonstrate that LPT can discover improved decisions from sub-optimal trajectories, achieving competitive performance across several benchmarks, including Gym-Mujoco, Franka Kitchen, Maze2D, and Connect Four. It exhibits capabilities in nuanced credit assignments, trajectory stitching, and adaptation to environmental contingencies. These results validate that latent variable inference can be a strong alternative to step-wise reward prompting.</p></details> |  |

Predicting and managing oil spill trajectories is highly complex, due to the interplay of physical, chemical, and environmental factors such as wind, currents, and temperature, which makes timely and effective response challenging. Accurate real-time trajectory forecasting and coordinated mitigation are vital for minimizing the impact of these disasters. This study introduces an integrated framework combining a multi-agent swarm robotics system built on the MOOS-IvP platform with Liquid Time-Constant Neural Networks (LTCNs). The proposed system fuses adaptive machine learning with autonomous marine robotics, enabling real-time prediction, dynamic tracking, and rapid response to evolving oil spills. By leveraging LTCNs--well-suited for modeling complex, time-dependent processes--the framework achieves real-time, high-accuracy forecasts of spill movement. Swarm intelligence enables decentralized, scalable, and resilient decision-making among robot agents, enhancing collective monitoring and containment efforts. Our approach was validated using data from the Deepwater Horizon spill, where the LTC-RK4 model achieved 0.96 spatial accuracy, surpassing LSTM approaches by 23%. The integration of advanced neural modeling with autonomous, coordinated robotics demonstrates substantial improvements in prediction precision, flexibility, and operational scalability. Ultimately, this research advances the state-of-the-art for sustainable, autonomous oil spill management and environmental protection by enhancing both trajectory prediction and response coordination.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 40 figures.

| **[Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion: Real-Time Trajectory Planning with Just-Enough Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12166v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots equipped with rich sensor suites can localize reliably in partially-observable environments, but powering every sensor continuously is wasteful and often infeasible. Belief-space planners address this by propagating pose-belief covariance through analytic models and switching sensors heuristically--a brittle, runtime-expensive approach. Data-driven approaches--including diffusion models--learn multi-modal trajectories from demonstrations, but presuppose an accurate, always-on state estimate. We address the largely open problem: for a given task in a mapped environment, which \textit{minimal sensor subset} must be active at each location to maintain state uncertainty \textit{just low enough} to complete the task? Our key insight is that when a diffusion planner is explicitly conditioned on a pose-belief raster and a sensor mask, the spread of its denoising trajectories yields a calibrated, differentiable proxy for the expected localisation error. Building on this insight, we present Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion (B-COD), the first planner that, in a 10 ms forward pass, returns a short-horizon trajectory, per-waypoint aleatoric variances, and a proxy for localisation error--eliminating external covariance rollouts. We show that this single proxy suffices for a soft-actor-critic to choose sensors online, optimising energy while bounding pose-covariance growth. We deploy B-COD in real-time marine trials on an unmanned surface vehicle and show that it reduces sensing energy consumption while matching the goal-reach performance of an always-on baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025 (Conference on Robot Learning)</p></details> |

This work proposes the Fast and Safe Data-Driven Planner to address this challenge. Sparse Gaussian predictions are introduced to improve both the computational efficiency and accuracy of opponent predictions. Furthermore, the proposed approach employs a bi-level quadratic programming framework to generate an overtaking trajectory leveraging the opponent predictions. The first level uses polynomial fitting to generate a rough trajectory, from which reference states and control inputs are derived for the second level. The second level formulates a model predictive control optimization problem in the Frenet frame, generating a trajectory that satisfies both kinematic feasibility and safety. Experimental results on the F1TENTH platform show that our method outperforms the State-of-the-Art, achieving an 8.93% higher overtaking success rate, allowing the maximum opponent speed, ensuring a smoother ego trajectory, and reducing 74.04% computational time compared to the Predictive Spliner method.

| **[On Delta-Homology Analogy: Memory as Structured Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04203v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the \emph{delta-homology analogy}, which formalizes memory as a set of sparse, topologically irreducible attractors. A \emph{Dirac delta-like memory trace} \( \delta_\gamma \) is identified with a nontrivial homology generator \( [\gamma] \in H_1(\mathcal{Z}) \) on a latent manifold of cognitive states. Such traces are sharply localized along reproducible topological cycles and are only activated when inference trajectories complete a full cycle. They encode minimal, path-dependent memory units that cannot be synthesized from local features alone. Based on the analogy, we propose a topological framework for memory and inference grounded in the structure of spike-timing dynamics and persistent homology. Starting from the observation that polychronous neural groups (PNGs) encode reproducible, time-locked spike sequences shaped by axonal delays and synaptic plasticity, we construct \emph{spatiotemporal complexes} whose temporally consistent transitions define chain complexes over which robust activation cycles emerge. These activation loops are abstracted into \emph{cell posets}, enabling a compact and causally ordered representation of neural activity with overlapping and compositional memory traces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-Impulse Trajectory Design in Two-Body Systems With Riemannian Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11612v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a new method for generating impulsive trajectories in restricted two-body systems by leveraging Riemannian geometry. The proposed method transforms the standard trajectory optimization problem into a purely geometric one that involves computing a set of geodesics for a suitable Riemannian metric. This transformation is achieved by defining a metric, specifically the Jacobi metric, that embeds the dynamics directly into the metric, so any geodesic of the metric is also a dynamically feasible trajectory. The method finds the fuel-optimal transfer trajectory by sampling candidate energy ($\Delta V$) changes for different points on the current and desired orbit, and efficiently computing and evaluating each candidate geodesic, which are equivalent to candidate orbit transfer trajectories via the Jacobi metric. The method bypasses the known issues of optimization-based methods, e.g., sensitivity to the initial guess, and can be applied to more complex two-body systems. The approach is demonstrated on the minimum-$\Delta V$ two-impulse phase-free orbit transfer problem, first on a Keplerian system and second on a system with a modeled $J_2$ perturbation. The proposed method is shown to meet or exceed the state-of-the-art methods in the minimum-$\Delta V$ problem in the Keplerian system. The generality and versatility of the approach is demonstrated by seamlessly including the $J_2$ perturbation, a case that many existing methods cannot handle. Numerical simulations and performance comparisons showcase the effectiveness of the approach.</p></details> |  |

Despite the growing interest and efforts in this field, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2) lack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for sufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a trajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies. TrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation Network (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data preprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports broadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to learn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet learns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual features with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive loss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an unsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video datasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e., soccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e., sports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results demonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video retrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in action spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action categories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning. Additionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications based on TrajSV.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by TCSVT</p></details> |

Existing methods encode map and agent positions and decode future trajectories in Cartesian coordinates. However, modeling the relationships between the ego vehicle and surrounding traffic elements in Cartesian space can be suboptimal, as it does not naturally capture the varying influence of different elements based on their relative distances and directions. To address this limitation, we adopt the Polar coordinate system, where positions are represented by radius and angle. This representation provides a more intuitive and effective way to model spatial changes and relative relationships, especially in terms of distance and directional influence. Based on this insight, we propose Polaris, a novel method that operates entirely in Polar coordinates, distinguishing itself from conventional Cartesian-based approaches. By leveraging the Polar representation, this method explicitly models distance and direction variations and captures relative relationships through dedicated encoding and refinement modules, enabling more structured and spatially aware trajectory prediction and planning. Extensive experiments on the challenging prediction (Argoverse 2) and planning benchmarks (nuPlan) demonstrate that Polaris achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[KDPE: A Kernel Density Estimation Strategy for Diffusion Policy Trajectory Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10511v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning robot policies that capture multimodality in the training data has been a long-standing open challenge for behavior cloning. Recent approaches tackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with generative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on a diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories. While achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that may lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First, the stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of generated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach, it can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training. Recent work focuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy either with large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms. Instead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that filters out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while keeping a low test-time computational overhead. For Kernel Density Estimation, we propose a manifold-aware kernel to model a probability density function for actions composed of end-effector Cartesian position, orientation, and gripper state. KDPE overall achieves better performance than Diffusion Policy on simulated single-arm tasks and real robot experiments.

This phenomena diminishes utility in production applications that repeatedly rely on common prompt templates or applications that frequently rely on LLMs for specific tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, language translation). Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that LLMs still tend to refuse responses to harmful instructions when those instructions are reframed to appear as benign tasks. Our mechanistic analysis reveal that LLMs follow distinct "constellation" patterns in embedding space as representations traverse layers, with each task maintaining consistent trajectories that shift predictably between refusal and non-refusal cases. We introduce SafeConstellations, an inference-time trajectory-shifting approach that tracks task-specific trajectory patterns and guides representations toward non-refusal pathways. By selectively guiding model behavior only on tasks prone to over-refusal, and by preserving general model behavior, our method reduces over-refusal rates by up to 73% with minimal impact on utility-offering a principled approach to mitigating over-refusals.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, existing fault-tolerant control methods exhibit significant oscillations during docking and separation, impacting system stability. To address this issue, we propose a novel fault-tolerant control reallocation method that adapts to an arbitrary number of modular robots and their assembly formations. The algorithm redistributes the expected collective force and torque required for MARS to individual units according to their moment arm relative to the center of MARS mass. Furthermore, we propose an agile trajectory planning method for MARS of arbitrary configurations, which is collision-avoiding and dynamically feasible. Our work represents the first comprehensive approach to enable fault-tolerant and collision avoidance flight for MARS. We validate our method through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved fault tolerance, enhanced trajectory tracking accuracy, and greater robustness in cluttered environments.

The main aim is to reconstruct GPS trajectories with high accuracy, independent of input data quality. Building upon the original algorithm, developed exclusively for aligning GPS signals to road networks, we extend its capabilities by integrating trajectory imputation. Our improvements also include the implementation of a distance-bounded interactive voting strategy to reduce computational complexity, as well as modifications to address missing data in the road network. Furthermore, we incorporate a custom-built asset derived from OpenStreetMap, enabling this approach to be smoothly applied in any geographic region covered by OpenStreetMap's road network. These advancements preserve the core strengths of the original algorithm while significantly extending its applicability to diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, a key challenge in such approaches lies in selecting an appropriate masking strategy. Previous studies have explored predefined masking techniques, including random and tube-based masking, as well as approaches that leverage key motion priors, optical flow and semantic cues from externally pre-trained models. In this work, we introduce a novel and generalizable Trajectory-Aware Adaptive Token Sampler (TATS), which models the motion dynamics of tokens and can be seamlessly integrated into the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework to select motion-centric tokens in videos. Additionally, we propose a unified training strategy that enables joint optimization of both MAE and TATS from scratch using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We show that our model allows for aggressive masking without compromising performance on the downstream task of action recognition while also ensuring that the pre-training remains memory efficient. Extensive experiments of the proposed approach across four benchmarks, including Something-Something v2, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, generalization, and efficiency of our work compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICCVW 2025 - Long Multi-Scene Video Foundations Workshop</p></details> |

To improve data quality with sparse trajectories as input, we systematically study two related research problems: trajectory recovery on road network, which aims to infer missing points to recover high-sampling trajectories, and map matching, which aims to map GPS points to road segments to determine underlying routes. In this paper, we present efficient methods TRMMA and MMA for accurate trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, where MMA serves as the first step of TRMMA. In MMA, we carefully formulate a classification task to map a GPS point from sparse trajectories to a road segment over a small candidate segment set, rather than the entire road network. We develop techniques in MMA to generate effective embeddings that capture the patterns of GPS data, directional information, and road segments, to accurately align sparse trajectories to routes. For trajectory recovery, TRMMA focuses on the segments in the route returned by MMA to infer missing points with position ratios on road segments, producing high-sampling trajectories efficiently by avoiding evaluation of all road segments. Specifically, in TRMMA, we design a dual-transformer encoding process to cohesively capture latent patterns in trajectories and routes, and an effective decoding technique to sequentially predict the position ratios and road segments of missing points. We conduct extensive experiments to compare TRMMA and MMA with numerous existing methods for trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, on 4 large real-world datasets. TRMMA and MMA consistently achieve the best result quality, often by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by 2025 IEEE 41st International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)</p></details> |

Most of the existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs (TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation. Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will be available at https://github.com.</p></details> |  |

We also explore the derivation of general GCS-compatible constraints and document an intuitive strategy for adapting general constraints to the framework. We show that ST-GCS produces equivalent trajectories to the standard GCS formulation when the environment is static. We then show ST-GCS operating in dynamic environments to find minimum distance collision-free trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages with references, 20 figures</p></details> |

However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness control mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.

Despite its significance, research in this domain remains relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories, incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories. We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming existing methods by a considerable margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>IROS ...</summary><p>IROS 2025 Camera-Ready Version</p></details> |

To provide a quantitative basis for understanding these behaviours, we investigate the global dynamics of such automata and we describe a method that allows us to compute the number of all configurations leading to short attractors in a limited number of time steps. This computation yields exact results in the thermodynamic limit (as the CA grid size grows to infinity), and is based on the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) that we adapt for our purposes. Specifically, given two parameters $(p, c)$ we are able to compute the entropy of all initial configurations converging to an attractor of size $c$ after $p$ time-steps. By calculating such statistics for various ECA rules, we establish a quantitative connection between the entropy and the qualitative Wolfram classification scheme. Class 1 rules rapidly converge to maximal entropy for stationary states ($c=1$) as $p$ increases. Class 2 rules also approach maximal entropy quickly for appropriate cycle lengths $c$, potentially requiring consideration of translations. Class 3 rules exhibit zero or low finite entropy that saturates after a short transient. Class 4 rules show finite positive entropy, similar to some Class 3 rules. This method provides a precise framework for quantifying trajectory statistics, although its exponential computational cost in $p+c$ restricts practical analysis to short trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, accepted to ALife 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents ESCoT, an enhanced step-based coordinate trajectory planning method for multiple car-like robots. ESCoT incorporates two key strategies: collaborative planning for local robot groups and replanning for duplicate configurations. These strategies effectively enhance the performance of step-based MVTP methods. Through extensive experiments, we show that ESCoT 1) in sparse scenarios, significantly improves solution quality compared to baseline step-based method, achieving up to 70% improvement in typical conflict scenarios and 34% in randomly generated scenarios, while maintaining high solving efficiency; and 2) in dense scenarios, outperforms all baseline methods, maintains a success rate of over 50% even in the most challenging configurations. The results demonstrate that ESCoT effectively solves MVTP, further extending the capabilities of step-based methods. Finally, practical robot tests validate the algorithm's applicability in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, it has seen limited usage in spaceflight applications due to its heavy computational demands that exceed the capability of most flight computers. In this work, we provide results on the first flight demonstration of using machine learning-based warm starts for accelerating trajectory optimization for the Astrobee free-flying robot on-board the International Space Station (ISS). We formulate a data-driven optimal control approach that trains a neural network to learn the structure of the trajectory generation problem being solved for by sequential convex programming (SCP). On-board, this trained neural network predicts solutions for the trajectory generation problem and relies on using the SCP solver to enforce safety constraints for the system. Our trained network reduces the number of solver iterations required for convergence in cases including rotational dynamics by 60% and in cases with obstacles drawn from the training distribution of the warm start model by 50%. This work represents a significant milestone in the use of learning-based control for spaceflight applications and a stepping stone for future advances in the use of machine learning for autonomous guidance, navigation, & control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2025 International Conference on Space Robotics (iSpaRo).

In developing regions where access to multimodal data is limited, relying solely on onboard GPS data remains indispensable despite inherent challenges. To address this problem, we propose GSMT, a hybrid model that integrates a Graph Attention Network (GAT) with a sequence-to-sequence Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and incorporates a task corrector capable of extracting complex behavioral patterns from large-scale trajectory data. The task corrector clusters historical trajectories to identify distinct motion patterns and fine-tunes the predictions generated by the GAT and RNN. Specifically, GSMT fuses dynamic bus information and static station information through embedded hybrid networks to perform trajectory prediction, and applies the task corrector for secondary refinement after the initial predictions are generated. This two-stage approach enables multi-node trajectory prediction among buses operating in dense urban traffic environments under complex conditions. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance in both short-term and long-term trajectory prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ITSC 2025</p></details> |

When performing such structural edits, these methods either fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape replacement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage is available at https://follow-your-shape.github.io/</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we propose the Multidimensional Adaptive Coefficient (MAC), a plug-in module for flow and diffusion models that extends conventional unidimensional coefficients to multidimensional ones and enables inference trajectory-wise adaptation. MAC is trained via simulation-based feedback through adversarial refinement. Empirical results across diverse frameworks and datasets demonstrate that MAC enhances generative quality with high training efficiency. Consequently, our work offers a new perspective on inference trajectory optimality, encouraging future research to move beyond vector field design and to leverage training-efficient, simulation-based optimization.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Paper |
| **[Capsizing-Guided Trajectory Optimization for Autonomous Navigation with Rough Terrain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08108v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is a challenging task for ground robots to autonomously navigate in harsh environments due to the presence of non-trivial obstacles and uneven terrain. This requires trajectory planning that balances safety and efficiency. The primary challenge is to generate a feasible trajectory that prevents robot from tip-over while ensuring effective navigation. In this paper, we propose a capsizing-aware trajectory planner (CAP) to achieve trajectory planning on the uneven terrain. The tip-over stability of the robot on rough terrain is analyzed. Based on the tip-over stability, we define the traversable orientation, which indicates the safe range of robot orientations. This orientation is then incorporated into a capsizing-safety constraint for trajectory optimization. We employ a graph-based solver to compute a robust and feasible trajectory while adhering to the capsizing-safety constraint. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that CAP outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, providing enhanced navigation performance on uneven terrains.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches tend to address these tasks individually, making it difficult to holistically consider complex maritime situations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, AIS-LLM, which integrates time-series AIS data with a large language model (LLM). AIS-LLM consists of a Time-Series Encoder for processing AIS sequences, an LLM-based Prompt Encoder, a Cross-Modality Alignment Module for semantic alignment between time-series data and textual prompts, and an LLM-based Multi-Task Decoder. This architecture enables the simultaneous execution of three key tasks: trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and risk assessment of vessel collisions within a single end-to-end system. Experimental results demonstrate that AIS-LLM outperforms existing methods across individual tasks, validating its effectiveness. Furthermore, by integratively analyzing task outputs to generate situation summaries and briefings, AIS-LLM presents the potential for more intelligent and efficient maritime traffic management.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the use of sequential deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers, for real-time flock detection in multi-pedestrian trajectories. Our proposed approach consists of a two-stage process: first, a pre-trained binary classification model is used for pairwise trajectory classification, and second, the learned representations are applied to identify multi-agent flocks dynamically. We validate our method using real-world group movement datasets, demonstrating its robustness across varying sequence lengths and diverse movement patterns. Experimental results indicate that our model consistently detects pedestrian flocks with high accuracy and stability, even in dynamic and noisy environments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to identify other forms of collective motion, such as convoys and swarms, paving the way for more comprehensive multi-agent behavior analysis.</p></details> |  |

Traditional path planner, such as Artificial Potential Field (APF), offer computational efficiency but suffer from local minima issue due to position-based potential field functions and oscillatory motion near the obstacles due to Newtonian mechanics. To address this limitation, an Energy-based Artificial Potential Field (APF) framework is proposed in this paper that integrates position and velocity-dependent potential functions. E-APF ensures dynamic adaptability and mitigates local minima, enabling uninterrupted progression toward the goal. The proposed framework integrates E-APF with a hybrid trajectory optimizer that jointly minimizes jerk and execution time under velocity and acceleration constraints, ensuring geometric smoothness and time efficiency. The entire framework is validated in simulation using the 7-degree-of-freedom Kinova Gen3 robotic manipulator. The results demonstrate collision-free, smooth, time-efficient, and oscillation-free trajectory in the presence of obstacles, highlighting the efficacy of the combined trajectory optimization and real-time obstacle avoidance approach. This work lays the foundation for future integration with reactive control strategies and physical hardware deployment in real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Although Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable success in rendering static scenes, extending them to reconstruct dynamic scenes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that combines 3DGS with a motion trajectory field, enabling precise handling of complex object motions and achieving physically plausible motion trajectories. By decoupling dynamic objects from static background, our method compactly optimizes the motion trajectory field. The approach incorporates time-invariant motion coefficients and shared motion trajectory bases to capture intricate motion patterns while minimizing optimization complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in both novel-view synthesis and motion trajectory recovery from monocular video, advancing the capabilities of dynamic scene reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intention-Aware Diffusion Model for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07146v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for the path planning and motion control of autonomous vehicles. Recent diffusion-based models have shown promising results in capturing the inherent stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for trajectory prediction. However, the absence of explicit semantic modelling of pedestrian intent in many diffusion-based methods may result in misinterpreted behaviors and reduced prediction accuracy. To address the above challenges, we propose a diffusion-based pedestrian trajectory prediction framework that incorporates both short-term and long-term motion intentions. Short-term intent is modelled using a residual polar representation, which decouples direction and magnitude to capture fine-grained local motion patterns. Long-term intent is estimated through a learnable, token-based endpoint predictor that generates multiple candidate goals with associated probabilities, enabling multimodal and context-aware intention modelling. Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion process by incorporating adaptive guidance and a residual noise predictor that dynamically refines denoising accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated on the widely used ETH, UCY, and SDD benchmarks, demonstrating competitive results against state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiNash-PF: A Particle Filtering Approach for Computing Multiple Local Generalized Nash Equilibria in Trajectory Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05554v3)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern robotic systems frequently engage in complex multi-agent interactions, many of which are inherently multi-modal, i.e., they can lead to multiple distinct outcomes. To interact effectively, robots must recognize the possible interaction modes and adapt to the one preferred by other agents. In this work, we propose MultiNash-PF, an efficient algorithm for capturing the multimodality in multi-agent interactions. We model interaction outcomes as equilibria of a game-theoretic planner, where each equilibrium corresponds to a distinct interaction mode. Our framework formulates interactive planning as Constrained Potential Trajectory Games (CPTGs), in which local Generalized Nash Equilibria (GNEs) represent plausible interaction outcomes. We propose to integrate the potential game approach with implicit particle filtering, a sample-efficient method for non-convex trajectory optimization. We utilize implicit particle filtering to identify the coarse estimates of multiple local minimizers of the game's potential function. MultiNash-PF then refines these estimates with optimization solvers, obtaining different local GNEs. We show through numerical simulations that MultiNash-PF reduces computation time by up to 50\% compared to a baseline. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in real-world human-robot interaction scenarios, where it successfully accounts for the multi-modal nature of interactions and resolves potential conflicts in real-time.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches treat detection and forecasting as separate sequential tasks, limiting their ability to leverage temporal cues. ForeSight addresses this limitation with a multi-task streaming and bidirectional learning approach, allowing detection and forecasting to share query memory and propagate information seamlessly. The forecast-aware detection transformer enhances spatial reasoning by integrating trajectory predictions from a multiple hypothesis forecast memory queue, while the streaming forecast transformer improves temporal consistency using past forecasts and refined detections. Unlike tracking-based methods, ForeSight eliminates the need for explicit object association, reducing error propagation with a tracking-free model that efficiently scales across multi-frame sequences. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that ForeSight achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving an EPA of 54.9%, surpassing previous methods by 9.3%, while also attaining the best mAP and minADE among multi-view detection and forecasting models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

This work evaluates the integration of a deep learning-based Social-Implicit (SI) pedestrian trajectory predictor within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework on the physical Continental Corriere robot. Tested across varied pedestrian densities, the SI-MPC system is compared to a traditional Constant Velocity (CV) model in both open-loop prediction and closed-loop navigation. Results show that SI improves trajectory prediction - reducing errors by up to 76% in low-density settings - and enhances safety and motion smoothness in crowded scenes. Moreover, real-world deployment reveals discrepancies between open-loop metrics and closed-loop performance, as the SI model yields broader, more cautious predictions. These findings emphasize the importance of system-level evaluation and highlight the SI-MPC framework's promise for safer, more adaptive navigation in dynamic, human-populated environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[H2C: Hippocampal Circuit-inspired Continual Learning for Lifelong Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01158v2)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) has shown state-of-the-art performance in trajectory prediction, which is critical to safe navigation in autonomous driving (AD). However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this, we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION dataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C reduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a task-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts.

Current approaches mainly rely on ID-based features and region-specific data to learn correlations between cell towers and roads, limiting their adaptability to unexplored areas. To enable high-accuracy CTMM without additional training in target regions, Zero-shot CTMM requires to extract not only region-adaptive features, but also sequential and location uncertainty to alleviate positioning errors in cellular data. In this paper, we propose a pixel-based trajectory calibration assistant for zero-shot CTMM, which takes advantage of transferable geospatial knowledge to calibrate pixelated trajectory, and then guide the path-finding process at the road network level. To enhance knowledge sharing across similar regions, a Gaussian mixture model is incorporated into VAE, enabling the identification of scenario-adaptive experts through soft clustering. To mitigate high positioning errors, a spatial-temporal awareness module is designed to capture sequential features and location uncertainty, thereby facilitating the inference of approximate user positions. Finally, a constrained path-finding algorithm is employed to reconstruct the road ID sequence, ensuring topological validity within the road network. This process is guided by the calibrated trajectory while optimizing for the shortest feasible path, thus minimizing unnecessary detours. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in zero-shot CTMM by 16.8\%.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these challenges, we present the Neural-Enhanced Trajectory Planner (NEO-Planner), a novel approach that leverages a Neural Network (NN) Planner to provide informed initial values for trajectory optimization. The NN-Planner is trained on a dataset generated by an expert planner using batch sampling, capturing multimodal trajectory solutions. It learns to predict spatial and temporal parameters for trajectories directly from raw sensor observations. NEO-Planner starts optimization from these predictions, accelerating computation speed while maintaining explainability.

An essentially equivalent viewpoint arises through stability analysis of a linear differential inclusion (LDI) encompassing the incremental behavior of the system. In this note, we use contraction tools to study the exponential stability of a system to a particular known trajectory, deriving a new LDI characterizing the error between arbitrary trajectories and this known trajectory. As with classical contraction analysis, this new inclusion is constructed via first partial derivatives of the system's vector field, and convergence rates are obtained with familiar tools: uniform bounding of the logarithmic norm and LMI-based Lyapunov conditions. Our LDI is guaranteed to outperform a usual contraction analysis in two special circumstances: i) when the bound on the logarithmic norm arises from an interval overapproximation of the Jacobian matrix, and ii) when the norm considered is the $\ell_1$ norm. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed approach strictly improves an existing framework for ellipsoidal reachable set computation.</p></details> |  |

While many distillation methods that are solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in few-step video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trustworthy Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction via Pattern-Aware Interaction Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13397v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable pedestrian trajectory prediction is critical for the safety and robustness of intelligent applications, yet achieving trustworthy prediction remains highly challenging due to the complexity of interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods often adopt black-box modeling of pedestrian interactions, treating all neighbors uniformly. Despite their strong performance, such opaque modeling limits the reliability of predictions in safety-critical real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns (e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training strategy, termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model not only outperforms recent black-box baselines in prediction accuracy, especially under high-density scenarios, but also provides stronger interpretability, achieving a favorable trade-off between reliability and accuracy. Furthermore, the SSOS strategy proves to be effective in improving sequential prediction performance, reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.</p></details> |  |

To enhance the robustness of trajectory planning under environmental disturbances, this paper presents a disturbance-aware planning framework that incorporates real-time disturbance estimation into both path searching and trajectory optimization. A key component of the framework is a disturbance-adaptive safety boundary adjustment mechanism, which dynamically modifies the vehicle's feasible dynamic boundaries based on estimated disturbances to ensure trajectory feasibility. Leveraging the dynamics model of the bimodal vehicle, the proposed approach achieves adaptive and reliable motion planning across different terrains and operating conditions. A series of real-world experiments and benchmark comparisons on a custom-built platform validate the effectiveness and robustness of the method, demonstrating improvements in tracking accuracy, task efficiency, and energy performance under both ground and aerial disturbances.</p></details> |  |

Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer improved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost, limited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose two key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population diversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and improve alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo outperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and notably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to an unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics.

To address this critical gap, we introduce NaturalGAIA, a novel benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of agents, we developed LightManus, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. Our experiments reveal that NaturalGAIA presents a formidable challenge to current state-of-the-art LLMs; even the top-performing Claude-sonnet-4 achieved a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of only 34.6%. Moreover, while RFT substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR increased from 3.3% to 10.8%), its performance degraded sharply when handling complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception, decision-making, and execution. This research contributes a rigorous evaluation standard and a high-quality dataset to the community, aiming to guide the future development of GUI agents.</p></details> |  |

These include heavy computational burdens for mapping, sensor occlusion failures for UAVs, and traversal challenges on irregular terrain for UGVs, all compounded by a lack of perception-aware strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce Random Mapping and Random Projection (RMRP). This method constructs a lightweight linear parametric map by first mapping data to a high-dimensional space, followed by a sparse random projection for dimensionality reduction. Our novel Residual Energy Preservation Theorem provides theoretical guarantees for this process, ensuring critical geometric properties are preserved. Based on this map, we propose the RPATR (Robust Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner) framework. For UAVs, our method unifies grid and Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) maps. The front-end uses an analytical occupancy gradient to refine initial paths for safety and smoothness, while the back-end uses a closed-form ESDF for trajectory optimization. Leveraging the trained RMRP model's generalization, the planner predicts unobserved areas for proactive navigation. For UGVs, the model characterizes terrain and provides closed-form gradients, enabling online planning to circumvent large holes. Validated in diverse scenarios, our framework demonstrates superior mapping performance in time, memory, and accuracy, and enables computationally efficient, safe navigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs. The code will be released to foster community collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Theory and Practice of GRPO: A Trajectory-Corrected Approach with Fast Convergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02833v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), recently proposed by DeepSeek, is a critic-free reinforcement learning algorithm for fine tuning large language models. It replaces the value function in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with group normalized rewards, while retaining PPO style token level importance sampling based on an old policy. We show that GRPO update rule in fact estimates the policy gradient at the old policy rather than the current one. However, since the old policy is refreshed every few steps, the discrepancy between the two remains small limiting the impact of this bias in practice. We validate this through an ablation study in which importance sampling is entirely removed, and updates are instead performed using the gradient estimated at a fixed old policy across multiple optimization steps. Remarkably, this simplification results in performance comparable to standard GRPO. Motivated by these findings, we propose a new algorithm: Trajectory level Importance Corrected GRPO (TIC GRPO). TIC GRPO replaces token level importance ratios with a single trajectory level probability ratio, yielding an unbiased estimate of the current policy gradient while preserving the critic free structure. Furthermore, we present the first theoretical convergence analysis for GRPO style methods, covering both the original GRPO and our proposed variant.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of various prompting strategies in aiding LLMs in reasoning (called "reasoning actions"), such as step-by-step thinking, reflecting before answering, solving with programs, and their combinations. However, these approaches often applied static, predefined reasoning actions uniformly to all questions, without considering the specific characteristics of each question or the capability of the task-solving LLM. In this paper, we propose DOTS, an approach enabling LLMs to reason dynamically via optimal reasoning trajectory search, tailored to the specific characteristics of each question and the inherent capability of the task-solving LLM. Our approach involves three key steps: i) defining atomic reasoning action modules that can be composed into various reasoning action trajectories; ii) searching for the optimal action trajectory for each training question through iterative exploration and evaluation for the specific task-solving LLM; and iii) using the collected optimal trajectories to train an LLM to plan for the reasoning trajectories of unseen questions. In particular, we propose two learning paradigms, i.e., fine-tuning an external LLM as a planner to guide the task-solving LLM, or directly fine-tuning the task-solving LLM with an internalized capability for reasoning actions planning. Our experiments across eight reasoning tasks show that our method consistently outperforms static reasoning techniques and the vanilla instruction tuning approach. Further analysis reveals that our method enables LLMs to adjust their computation based on problem complexity, allocating deeper thinking and reasoning to harder problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

This paper proposes a hybrid trajectory planning framework that integrates the adaptability of learning-based methods with the formal safety guarantees of optimization-based approaches. The framework features a two-layer architecture: an upper layer employing a graph neural network (GNN) trained on real-world highway data to predict human-like longitudinal velocity profiles, and a lower layer utilizing path optimization formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. The primary contribution is the lower-layer path optimization model, which introduces a linear approximation of discretized vehicle geometry to substantially reduce computational complexity, while enforcing strict spatiotemporal non-overlapping constraints to formally guarantee collision avoidance throughout the planning horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that the planner generates highly smooth, collision-free trajectories in complex real-world emergency scenarios, achieving success rates exceeding 97% with average planning times of 54 ms, thereby confirming real-time capability.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately forecasting crowd trajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and uncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown promising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for trajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly incorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit the interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we propose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that incorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The motion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and a pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to effectively capture these intentions. Furthermore, we adopt an efficient guidance mechanism that facilitates the generation of interpretable trajectories. The proposed framework is evaluated on two widely used human trajectory prediction benchmarks, ETH and UCY, on which it is compared against state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at the 28th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), 2025</p></details> |

Most community models and datasets in the T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect, primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

While recent advances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action recognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points to track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a novel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational tokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling strategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and semantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that captures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action patterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with semantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information, achieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action recognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits), Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym.

This study presents an infrastructure-enabled proactive work zone safety warning system that leverages a Digital Twin environment, integrating real-time multi-sensor data, detailed High-Definition (HD) maps, and a historical prediction attention mechanism-based trajectory prediction model. Using a co-simulation environment that combines Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) and CAR Learning to Act (CARLA) simulators, along with Lanelet2 HD maps and the Historical Prediction Network (HPNet) model, we demonstrate effective trajectory prediction and early warning generation for vehicle interactions in freeway work zones. To evaluate the accuracy of predicted trajectories, we use two standard metrics: Joint Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Joint Final Displacement Error (FDE). Specifically, the infrastructure-enabled HPNet model demonstrates superior performance on the work-zone datasets generated from the co-simulation environment, achieving a minimum Joint FDE of 0.3228 meters and a minimum Joint ADE of 0.1327 meters, lower than the benchmarks on the Argoverse (minJointFDE: 1.0986 m, minJointADE: 0.7612 m) and Interaction (minJointFDE: 0.8231 m, minJointADE: 0.2548 m) datasets. In addition, our proactive safety warning generation application, utilizing vehicle bounding boxes and probabilistic conflict modeling, demonstrates its capability to issue alerts for potential vehicle conflicts.</p></details> |  |
| **[T-GVC: Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding at Ultra-Low Bitrates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07633v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging paradigm of generative video coding for Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging powerful generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or excessive dependence on high-level text guidance, which tend to inadequately capture fine-grained motion details, leading to unrealistic or incoherent reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding (dubbed T-GVC), a novel framework that bridges low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding. T-GVC features a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline that extracts pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic importance, significantly reducing the bitrate while preserving critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by integrating trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a training-free guidance mechanism in latent space to ensure physically plausible motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative models. Experimental results demonstrate that T-GVC outperforms both traditional and neural video codecs under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our framework achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided by geometric motion modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[WaMo: Wavelet-Enhanced Multi-Frequency Trajectory Analysis for Fine-Grained Text-Motion Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03343v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-Motion Retrieval (TMR) aims to retrieve 3D motion sequences semantically relevant to text descriptions. However, matching 3D motions with text remains highly challenging, primarily due to the intricate structure of human body and its spatial-temporal dynamics. Existing approaches often overlook these complexities, relying on general encoding methods that fail to distinguish different body parts and their dynamics, limiting precise semantic alignment. To address this, we propose WaMo, a novel wavelet-based multi-frequency feature extraction framework. It fully captures part-specific and time-varying motion details across multiple resolutions on body joints, extracting discriminative motion features to achieve fine-grained alignment with texts. WaMo has three key components: (1) Trajectory Wavelet Decomposition decomposes motion signals into frequency components that preserve both local kinematic details and global motion semantics. (2) Trajectory Wavelet Reconstruction uses learnable inverse wavelet transforms to reconstruct original joint trajectories from extracted features, ensuring the preservation of essential spatial-temporal information. (3) Disordered Motion Sequence Prediction reorders shuffled motion sequences to improve the learning of inherent temporal coherence, enhancing motion-text alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate WaMo's superiority, achieving 17.0\% and 18.2\% improvements in $Rsum$ on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets, respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Text to Trajectory: Exploring Complex Constraint Representation and Decomposition in Safe Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08920v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe reinforcement learning (RL) requires the agent to finish a given task while obeying specific constraints. Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

In this work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second, reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in imitation learning.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in accelerating CoT reasoning.</p></details> |  |

So far, a substantial body of control research has focused on emulating snake locomotion and replicating its distinctive movement patterns using shape functions that either ignore the complexity of interactions or focus on complex interactions with matter (e.g., burrowing movements). However, models and control frameworks that lie in between these two paradigms and are based on simple, fundamental rigid body dynamics, which alleviate the challenging contact and control allocation problems in snake locomotion, remain absent. This work makes meaningful contributions, substantiated by simulations and experiments, in the following directions: 1) introducing a reduced-order model based on Moreau's stepping-forward approach from differential inclusion mathematics, 2) verifying model accuracy, 3) experimental validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Approximators for Low-Thrust Trajectory Transfer Cost and Reachability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02911v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In trajectory design, fuel consumption and trajectory reachability are two key performance indicators for low-thrust missions. This paper proposes general-purpose pretrained neural networks to predict these metrics. The contributions of this paper are as follows: Firstly, based on the confirmation of the Scaling Law applicable to low-thrust trajectory approximation, the largest dataset is constructed using the proposed homotopy ray method, which aligns with mission-design-oriented data requirements. Secondly, the data are transformed into a self-similar space, enabling the neural network to adapt to arbitrary semi-major axes, inclinations, and central bodies. This extends the applicability beyond existing studies and can generalize across diverse mission scenarios without retraining. Thirdly, to the best of our knowledge, this work presents the current most general and accurate low-thrust trajectory approximator, with implementations available in C++, Python, and MATLAB. The resulting neural network achieves a relative error of 0.78% in predicting velocity increments and 0.63% in minimum transfer time estimation. The models have also been validated on a third-party dataset, multi-flyby mission design problem, and mission analysis scenario, demonstrating their generalization capability, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

This paper establishes a method that approaches global optimality for multi-flyby trajectory optimization under a given sequence. The original optimal control problem with interior-point equality constraints is transformed into a multi-stage decision formulation. This reformulation enables direct application of dynamic programming in lower dimensions, and follows Bellman's principle of optimality. Moreover, the method provides a quantifiable bound on global optima errors introduced by discretization and approximation assumptions, thus ensuring a measure of confidence in the obtained solution. The method accommodates both impulsive and low-thrust maneuver schemes in rendezvous and flyby scenarios. Several computational techniques are introduced to enhance efficiency, including a specialized solution for bi-impulse cases and an adaptive step refinement strategy. The proposed method is validated through three problems: 1) an impulsive variant of the fourth Global Trajectory Optimization competition problem (GTOC4), 2) the GTOC11 problem, and 3) the original low-thrust GTOC4 problem. Each case demonstrates improvements in fuel consumption over the best-known trajectories. These results give evidence of the generality and effectiveness of the proposed method in global trajectory optimization.</p></details> |  |

Many existing approaches assume access to other agents' episodic trajectories, a condition often unrealistic in real-world applications. Consequently, a practical agent modeling approach must learn a robust representation of the policies of the other agents based only on the local trajectory of the controlled agent. In this paper, we propose \texttt{TransAM}, a novel transformer-based agent modeling approach to encode local trajectories into an embedding space that effectively captures the policies of other agents. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in cooperative, competitive, and mixed multi-agent environments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach generates strong policy representations, improves agent modeling, and leads to higher episodic returns.</p></details> |  |
| **[User Trajectory Prediction Unifying Global and Local Temporal Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02161v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is essential for formulating proactive strategies that anticipate user mobility and support advance preparation. Therefore, how to reduce the forecasting error in user trajectory prediction within an acceptable inference time arises as an interesting issue. However, trajectory data contains both global and local temporal information, complicating the extraction of the complete temporal pattern. Moreover, user behavior occurs over different time scales, increasing the difficulty of capturing behavioral patterns. To address these challenges, a trajectory prediction model based on multilayer perceptron (MLP), multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN), and cross-attention (CA) is proposed. Specifically, MLP is used to extract the global temporal information of each feature. In parallel, MSCNN is employed to extract the local temporal information by modeling interactions among features within a local temporal range. Convolutional kernels with different sizes are used in MSCNN to capture temporal information at multiple resolutions, enhancing the model's adaptability to different behavioral patterns. Finally, CA is applied to fuse the global and local temporal information. Experimental results show that our model reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 5.04% and mean absolute error (MAE) by 4.35% compared with ModernTCN in 12-step prediction, while maintaining similar inference time.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the imbalance between self-consistency and cross-consistency, these CD-based methods inherently suffer from improper conditional guidance, leading to sub-optimal generation results. To address this issue, we present SegmentDreamer, a novel framework designed to fully unleash the potential of consistency models for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation. Specifically, we reformulate SDS through the proposed Segmented Consistency Trajectory Distillation (SCTD), effectively mitigating the imbalance issues by explicitly defining the relationship between self- and cross-consistency. Moreover, SCTD partitions the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories and ensures consistency within each segment, which can theoretically provide a significantly tighter upper bound on distillation error. Additionally, we propose a distillation pipeline for a more swift and stable generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SegmentDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, enabling high-fidelity 3D asset creation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025, project page: https://zjhjojo.github.io/segmentdreamer/</p></details> |

Starting from the observation that polychronous neural groups (PNGs) encode reproducible, time-locked spike sequences shaped by axonal delays and synaptic plasticity, we construct spatiotemporal complexes whose temporally consistent transitions define chain complexes over which robust activation cycles emerge. These activation loops are abstracted into cell posets, enabling a compact and causally ordered representation of neural activity with overlapping and compositional memory traces. We introduce the delta-homology analogy, which formalizes memory as a set of sparse, topologically irreducible attractors. A Dirac delta-like memory trace is identified with a nontrivial homology generator on a latent manifold of cognitive states. Such traces are sharply localized along reproducible topological cycles and are only activated when inference trajectories complete a full cycle. They encode minimal, path-dependent memory units that cannot be synthesized from local features alone. We interpret these delta-homology generators as the low-entropy content variable, while the high-entropy context variable is represented dually as a filtration, cohomology class, or sheaf over the same latent space. Inference is recast as a dynamic alignment between content and context and coherent memory retrieval corresponds to the existence of a global section that selects and sustains a topological generator. Memory is no longer a static attractor or distributed code, but a cycle-completing, structure-aware inference process.</p></details> |  |

To reduce the risk of disrupting operations, we leverage advances in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) to combine physics with data-driven models, developing a neural state-space model (NSSM) that predicts plasma dynamics during Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) rampdowns. The NSSM efficiently learns dynamics from a modest dataset of 311 pulses with only five pulses in a reactor-relevant high-performance regime. The NSSM is parallelized across uncertainties, and reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to design trajectories that avoid instability limits. High-performance experiments at TCV show statistically significant improvements in relevant metrics. A predict-first experiment, increasing plasma current by 20% from baseline, demonstrates the NSSM's ability to make small extrapolations. The developed approach paves the way for designing tokamak controls with robustness to considerable uncertainty and demonstrates the relevance of SciML for fusion experiments.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory and communication optimization for low-altitude air-ground cooperation systems, where mobile unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) upload data to UAVs. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to maximize the minimal sum-rate of UGVs while ensuring quality of service and navigation constraints. The proposed algorithm integrates a successive convex approximation (SCA)-penalty method for UGV-UAV scheduling, an SCA-based approach for UGV transmit power control, and a novel warm-start particle swarm optimization with cross mutation (WS-PSO-CM). The WS-PSO-CM leverages convex optimization results from a statistical channel model to initialize particle swarm, significantly improving the performance, compared with celebrated PSO-CM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a $45.8$\% higher minimal sum-rate compared to the baseline PSO-CM under the same iterations. This gain can be translated to reducing computational time by $46.7$\% of PSO-CM. Furthermore, our simulation results reveal that UAVs dynamically adjust trajectories to avoid interference by buildings, and maintain proximity to UGVs to mitigate path-loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; 6 figures; submit to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Our approach outperforms a baseline using hand-crafted features in the majority of tasks. Evaluating on N-shot classification suggests using JSON-Bag prototype to represent game trajectory classes is also sample efficient. Additionally, we demonstrate JSON-Bag ability for automatic feature extraction by treating tokens as individual features to be used in Random Forest to solve the tasks above, which significantly improves accuracy on underperforming tasks.

Longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) provide a uniquely powerful opportunity for the prediction. However, it is challenging to accurately model the continuous clinical progression of patients underlying the irregularly sampled clinical features and to transparently link the progression to survival outcomes. To address these challenges, we develop TrajSurv, a model that learns continuous latent trajectories from longitudinal EHR data for trustworthy survival prediction. TrajSurv employs a neural controlled differential equation (NCDE) to extract continuous-time latent states from the irregularly sampled data, forming continuous latent trajectories. To ensure the latent trajectories reflect the clinical progression, TrajSurv aligns the latent state space with patient state space through a time-aware contrastive learning approach. To transparently link clinical progression to the survival outcome, TrajSurv uses latent trajectories in a two-step divide-and-conquer interpretation process. First, it explains how the changes in clinical features translate into the latent trajectory's evolution using a learned vector field.

Inspired by the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Unlike existing encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that the model is always provided with up-to-date information, thereby enhancing performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the model the auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This allows the model to better anticipate the future and further improves performance. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs can exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender. Moreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and message-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias by filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge dropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may unintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised balance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias mitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using counterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node representations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial discriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN classifiers. Our proposed technique, Fair-ICD, ensures the fairness of GNNs under moderate conditions. Experiments on standard datasets using three GNN backbones demonstrate that Fair-ICD notably enhances fairness metrics while preserving high predictive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 2024 KDD Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Learnable Kernel Density Estimation for Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21285v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes a framework LGKDE that learns kernel density estimation for graphs. The key challenge in graph density estimation lies in effectively capturing both structural patterns and semantic variations while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Combining graph kernels and kernel density estimation (KDE) is a standard approach to graph density estimation, but has unsatisfactory performance due to the handcrafted and fixed features of kernels. Our method LGKDE leverages graph neural networks to represent each graph as a discrete distribution and utilizes maximum mean discrepancy to learn the graph metric for multi-scale KDE, where all parameters are learned by maximizing the density of graphs relative to the density of their well-designed perturbed counterparts. The perturbations are conducted on both node features and graph spectra, which helps better characterize the boundary of normal density regions. Theoretically, we establish consistency and convergence guarantees for LGKDE, including bounds on the mean integrated squared error, robustness, and complexity. We validate LGKDE by demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering the underlying density of synthetic graph distributions and applying it to graph anomaly detection across diverse benchmark datasets. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that LGKDE demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on most benchmark datasets.</p></details> | Under Review |

These models feature uniqueness in efficient computation as well as rich expressiveness, which stems from advanced management and profound understanding of graph data. However, few systematic studies have been conducted to assess spectral GNNs, particularly in benchmarking their efficiency, memory consumption, and effectiveness in a unified and fair manner. There is also a pressing need to select spectral models suitable for learning specific graph data and deploying them to massive web-scale graphs, which is currently constrained by the varied model designs and training settings. In this work, we extensively benchmark spectral GNNs with a focus on the spectral perspective, demystifying them as spectral graph filters. We analyze and categorize 35 GNNs with 27 corresponding filters, spanning diverse formulations and utilizations of the graph data. Then, we implement the filters within a unified spectral-oriented framework with dedicated graph computations and efficient training schemes. In particular, our implementation enables the deployment of spectral GNNs over million-scale graphs and various tasks with comparable performance and less overhead. Thorough experiments are conducted on the graph filters with comprehensive metrics on effectiveness and efficiency, offering novel observations and practical guidelines that are only available from our evaluations across graph scales. Different from the prevailing belief, our benchmark reveals an intricate landscape regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of spectral graph filters, demonstrating the potential to achieve desirable performance through tailored spectral manipulation of graph data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report with Appendix.

| **[Knowledge Graph-Infused Fine-Tuning for Structured Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14427v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problems of missing reasoning chains and insufficient entity-level semantic understanding in large language models when dealing with tasks that require structured knowledge. It proposes a fine-tuning algorithm framework based on knowledge graph injection. The method builds on pretrained language models and introduces structured graph information for auxiliary learning. A graph neural network is used to encode entities and their relations, constructing a graph-based semantic representation. A fusion mechanism is then designed to jointly model the knowledge graph embeddings with the contextual representations from the language model. To enhance the robustness of knowledge integration, a gating mechanism is introduced to dynamically balance the contributions of linguistic semantics and structural knowledge. This effectively mitigates conflicts between different representational spaces. During training, a joint loss function is constructed to account for both task performance and structural alignment objectives. This helps improve the accuracy of entity prediction and semantic reasoning. The study also includes a series of systematic sensitivity experiments. It evaluates the effects of learning rate, graph coverage, and structural perturbations on model performance. The results further validate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed method across tasks such as entity recognition, question answering, and language generation. Experimental findings show that the proposed structure-aware fine-tuning framework significantly enhances the model's ability to represent complex semantic units. It demonstrates better semantic consistency and contextual logic modeling in scenarios involving structural reasoning and entity extraction.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Interplay between Graph Structure and Learning Algorithms in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14338v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the interplay between learning algorithms and graph structure for graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing theoretical studies on the learning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning algorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude connection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum degree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk (generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the generalization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional settings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine how graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several key contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure and learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and Ridge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure through spectral graph theory. With this established framework, we further explore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the performance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we extend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing non-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights into the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning algorithms. Our empirical results align with our theoretical predictions, \emph{collectively showcasing a coupling relation among graph structure, GNNs and learning algorithms, and providing insights on GNN algorithm design and selection in practice.}</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14330v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition (GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gctd-345A.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReviewGraph: A Knowledge Graph Embedding Based Framework for Review Rating Prediction with Sentiment Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13953v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the hospitality industry, understanding the factors that drive customer review ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business performance. This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP), a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers. We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature, our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with lower computational cost (without ensemble). While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods. We will share ReviewGraph output and platform open-sourced on our GitHub page https://github.com/aaronlifenghan/ReviewGraph</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Up without Fading Out: Goal-Aware Sparse GNN for RL-based Generalized Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10747v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow, especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale generalized planning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Refining Contrastive Learning and Homography Relations for Multi-Modal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13745v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal recommender system focuses on utilizing rich modal information ( i.e., images and textual descriptions) of items to improve recommendation performance. The current methods have achieved remarkable success with the powerful structure modeling capability of graph neural networks. However, these methods are often hindered by sparse data in real-world scenarios. Although contrastive learning and homography ( i.e., homogeneous graphs) are employed to address the data sparsity challenge, existing methods still suffer two main limitations: 1) Simple multi-modal feature contrasts fail to produce effective representations, causing noisy modal-shared features and loss of valuable information in modal-unique features; 2) The lack of exploration of the homograph relations between user interests and item co-occurrence results in incomplete mining of user-item interplay. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for \textbf{R}\textbf{E}fining multi-mod\textbf{A}l cont\textbf{R}astive learning and ho\textbf{M}ography relations (\textbf{REARM}). Specifically, we complement multi-modal contrastive learning by employing meta-network and orthogonal constraint strategies, which filter out noise in modal-shared features and retain recommendation-relevant information in modal-unique features. To mine homogeneous relationships effectively, we integrate a newly constructed user interest graph and an item co-occurrence graph with the existing user co-occurrence and item semantic graphs for graph learning. The extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of REARM to various state-of-the-art baselines. Our visualization further shows an improvement made by REARM in distinguishing between modal-shared and modal-unique features.

| **[CaPGNN: Optimizing Parallel Graph Neural Network Training with Joint Caching and Resource-Aware Graph Partitioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13716v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable capabilities in processing graph-structured data prevalent in various real-world applications. However, the scalability of full-batch GNN training becomes severely limited by high communication overhead and load imbalance in distributed environments. In this paper, we present CaPGNN, a novel framework for efficient parallel full-batch GNN training on single-server with multi-GPU, designed specifically to reduce redundant inter-GPU communication and balance computational workloads. We propose a joint adaptive caching algorithm that leverages both CPU and GPU memory to significantly reduce the repetitive transmission of vertex features across partitions. Additionally, we introduce a resource-aware graph partitioning algorithm that adjusts subgraph sizes dynamically according to the heterogeneous computational and communication capacities of GPUs. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that CaPGNN effectively reduces communication costs by up to 96% and accelerates GNN training by up to 12.7 times compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our results highlight the potential of adaptive caching and resource-aware partitioning to facilitate scalable, efficient, and practical deployment of full-batch GNN training in distributed computing environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[SVDformer: Direction-Aware Spectral Graph Embedding Learning via SVD and Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13435v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed graphs are widely used to model asymmetric relationships in real-world systems. However, existing directed graph neural networks often struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[LOOP: A Plug-and-Play Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Enhancing Planning in Autonomous Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13371v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains, producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships, multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical real-world applications.</p></details> | Submitted to IAAI-26 |

Given a hierarchical representation of the environment, the objective is to navigate from a start position to a goal, while satisfying task-specific safety constraints and minimizing computational cost. We introduce Hierarchical Class-ordered A* (HCOA*), an algorithm that leverages the environment's hierarchy for efficient and safe path-planning in mixed geometric/semantic graphs. We use a total order over the semantic classes and prove theoretical performance guarantees for the algorithm. We propose three approaches for higher-layer node classification based on the semantics of the lowest layer: a Graph Neural Network method, a k-Nearest Neighbors method, and a Majority-Class method. We evaluate HCOA* in simulations on two 3D Scene Graphs, comparing it to the state-of-the-art and assessing the performance of each classification approach. Results show that HCOA* reduces the computational time of navigation by up to 50%, while maintaining near-optimal performance across a wide range of scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[GraphLand: Evaluating Graph Machine Learning Models on Diverse Industrial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14500v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although data that can be naturally represented as graphs is widespread in real-world applications across diverse industries, popular graph ML benchmarks for node property prediction only cover a surprisingly narrow set of data domains, and graph neural networks (GNNs) are often evaluated on just a few academic citation networks. This issue is particularly pressing in light of the recent growing interest in designing graph foundation models. These models are supposed to be able to transfer to diverse graph datasets from different domains, and yet the proposed graph foundation models are often evaluated on a very limited set of datasets from narrow applications. To alleviate this issue, we introduce GraphLand: a benchmark of 14 diverse graph datasets for node property prediction from a range of different industrial applications. GraphLand allows evaluating graph ML models on a wide range of graphs with diverse sizes, structural characteristics, and feature sets, all in a unified setting. Further, GraphLand allows investigating such previously underexplored research questions as how realistic temporal distributional shifts under transductive and inductive settings influence graph ML model performance. To mimic realistic industrial settings, we use GraphLand to compare GNNs with gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) models that are popular in industrial applications and show that GBDTs provided with additional graph-based input features can sometimes be very strong baselines. Further, we evaluate currently available general-purpose graph foundation models and find that they fail to produce competitive results on our proposed datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoTO: Robust Topology Obfuscation Against Tomography Inference Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12852v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tomography inference attacks aim to reconstruct network topology by analyzing end-to-end probe delays. Existing defenses mitigate these attacks by manipulating probe delays to mislead inference, but rely on two strong assumptions: (i) probe packets can be perfectly detected and altered, and (ii) attackers use known, fixed inference algorithms. These assumptions often break in practice, leading to degraded defense performance under detection errors or adaptive adversaries. We present RoTO, a robust topology obfuscation scheme that eliminates both assumptions by modeling uncertainty in attacker-observed delays through a distributional formulation. RoTO casts the defense objective as a min-max optimization problem that maximizes expected topological distortion across this uncertainty set, without relying on perfect probe control or specific attacker models. To approximate attacker behavior, RoTO leverages graph neural networks for inference simulation and adversarial training. We also derive an upper bound on attacker success probability, and demonstrate that our approach enhances topology obfuscation performance through the optimization of this upper bound. Experimental results show that RoTO outperforms existing defense methods, achieving average improvements of 34% in structural similarity and 42.6% in link distance while maintaining strong robustness and concealment capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Multi-Agent Epistemic Planning through GNN-Derived Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12840v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) is an autonomous planning framework for reasoning about both the physical world and the beliefs of agents, with applications in domains where information flow and awareness among agents are critical. The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance, resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate them against standard baselines, showing significant improvements in the scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Modeling of Full-Atom Protein Conformations using Latent Diffusion on Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17064v4)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of dynamic proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for understanding their function, yet most generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore conformational diversity altogether. We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (main text), 4 figures, 2 tables.

| **[S2FGL: Spatial Spectral Federated Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02409v4)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL from the structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label signals and a degradation in the semantic knowledge of the global GNN. From a spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drift occurs, undermining global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global knowledge repository to mitigate the challenge of poor semantic knowledge caused by label signal disruption. Furthermore, we design a frequency alignment to address spectral client drift. The combination of Spatial and Spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[MPOCryptoML: Multi-Pattern based Off-Chain Crypto Money Laundering Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12641v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in money laundering detection have demonstrated the potential of using graph neural networks to capture laundering patterns accurately. However, existing models are not explicitly designed to detect the diverse patterns of off-chain cryptocurrency money laundering. Neglecting any laundering pattern introduces critical detection gaps, as each pattern reflects unique transactional structures that facilitate the obfuscation of illicit fund origins and movements. Failure to account for these patterns may result in under-detection or omission of specific laundering activities, diminishing model accuracy and allowing schemes to bypass detection. To address this gap, we propose the MPOCryptoML model to effectively detect multiple laundering patterns in cryptocurrency transactions. MPOCryptoML includes the development of a multi-source Personalized PageRank algorithm to identify random laundering patterns. Additionally, we introduce two novel algorithms by analyzing the timestamp and weight of transactions in high-volume financial networks to detect various money laundering structures, including fan-in, fan-out, bipartite, gather-scatter, and stack patterns. We further examine correlations between these patterns using a logistic regression model. An anomaly score function integrates results from each module to rank accounts by anomaly score, systematically identifying high-risk accounts. Extensive experiments on public datasets including Elliptic++, Ethereum fraud detection, and Wormhole transaction datasets validate the efficacy and efficiency of MPOCryptoML. Results show consistent performance gains, with improvements up to 9.13% in precision, up to 10.16% in recall, up to 7.63% in F1-score, and up to 10.19% in accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Toward this goal, significant effort has focused on developing models that jointly sample molecular topology and 3D structure. We present FlowMol3, an open-source, multi-modal flow matching model that advances the state of the art for all-atom, small-molecule generation. Its substantial performance gains over previous FlowMol versions are achieved without changes to the graph neural network architecture or the underlying flow matching formulation. Instead, FlowMol3's improvements arise from three architecture-agnostic techniques that incur negligible computational cost: self-conditioning, fake atoms, and train-time geometry distortion. FlowMol3 achieves nearly 100% molecular validity for drug-like molecules with explicit hydrogens, more accurately reproduces the functional group composition and geometry of its training data, and does so with an order of magnitude fewer learnable parameters than comparable methods. We hypothesize that these techniques mitigate a general pathology affecting transport-based generative models, enabling detection and correction of distribution drift during inference. Our results highlight simple, transferable strategies for improving the stability and quality of diffusion- and flow-based molecular generative models.</p></details> |  |

In addition, our method features a graphical representation utilizing the symmetric tensor network, which simplifies both the proofs and constructions related to invariant and equivariant functions.

While prior methods rely on invasive signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) for high predictive accuracy, these approaches require specialized hardware and are impractical for real-world applications. In this work, we propose a scalable, deployable framework for personalized cybersickness prediction leveraging only non-invasive signals readily available from commercial VR headsets, including head motion, eye tracking, and physiological responses. Our model employs a modality-specific graph neural network enhanced with a Difference Attention Module to extract temporal-spatial embeddings capturing dynamic changes across modalities. A cross-modal alignment module jointly trains the video encoder to learn personalized traits by aligning video features with sensor-derived representations. Consequently, the model accurately predicts individual cybersickness using only video input during inference. Experimental results show our model achieves 88.4\% accuracy, closely matching EEG-based approaches (89.16\%), while reducing deployment complexity. With an average inference latency of 90ms, our framework supports real-time applications, ideal for integration into consumer-grade VR platforms without compromising personalization or performance.

| **[SGPT: Few-Shot Prompt Tuning for Signed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12155v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are effective in learning expressive representations for signed graphs but typically require substantial task-specific labels, limiting their applicability in label-scarce industrial scenarios. In contrast, unsigned graph structures are abundant and can be readily leveraged to pre-train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offering a promising solution to reduce supervision requirements in downstream signed graph tasks. However, transferring knowledge from unsigned to signed graphs is non-trivial due to the fundamental discrepancies in graph types and task objectives between pre-training and downstream phases. To address this challenge, we propose Signed Graph Prompt Tuning (SGPT), a novel graph prompting framework that adapts pre-trained unsigned GNNs to few-shot signed graph tasks. We first design a graph template based on balance theory to disentangle mixed node relationships introduced by negative links, mitigating the structural mismatches between unsigned and signed graphs. We further introduce a task template that reformulates downstream signed tasks into a unified link prediction objective, aligning their optimization goals with the pre-training task. Furthermore, we develop feature prompts that align downstream semantic spaces with the feature spaces learned during pre-training, and semantic prompts to integrate link sign semantics in a task-aware manner. We conduct extensive experiments on seven benchmark signed graph datasets, demonstrating that SGPT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, establishing a powerful and generalizable solution for few-shot signed graph learning.</p></details> | CIKM'25 |
| **[CRoC: Context Refactoring Contrast for Graph Anomaly Detection with Limited Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12278v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used as the engine for various graph-related tasks, with their effectiveness in analyzing graph-structured data. However, training robust GNNs often demands abundant labeled data, which is a critical bottleneck in real-world applications. This limitation severely impedes progress in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD), where anomalies are inherently rare, costly to label, and may actively camouflage their patterns to evade detection. To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring Contrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by jointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from previous works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor the context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the attributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore, CRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the message-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex interaction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while encouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover intricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated with the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness unlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative node embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRoC achieves up to 14% AUC improvement over baseline GNNs and outperforms state-of-the-art GAD methods under limited-label settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECAI 2025</p></details> |

While adhering to an assigned travel budget the algorithm seeks to maximize collected reward while incurring stochastic travel costs. In this context, the acceptable probability of exceeding the assigned budget is expressed as a chance constraint. Our MCTS solution is an online and anytime algorithm alternating planning and execution that determines the next vertex to visit by continuously monitoring the remaining travel budget. The novelty of our work is that the rollout phase in the MCTS framework is implemented using a message passing GNN, predicting both the utility and failure probability of each available action. This allows to enormously expedite the search process. Our experimental evaluation shows that with the proposed method and architecture we manage to efficiently solve complex problem instances while incurring in moderate losses in terms of collected reward. Moreover, we demonstrate how the approach is capable of generalizing beyond the characteristics of the training dataset.

| **[Implicit Hypergraph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14101v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for capturing high-order relationships between entities and have been widely applied in various domains, including healthcare, social networks, and bioinformatics. Hypergraph neural networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks. Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance. Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICDM 2025</p></details> |

However, current reasoning models often lack explicit semantic hierarchies, user-domain knowledge alignment, and principled mechanisms to prune reasoning threads for effectiveness. These limitations result in lengthy generic output that does not guide users through goal-oriented reasoning steps. To address this, we propose a prototype-inspired, two-phases Reasoning-Threads-Evaluation (ReT-Eval) framework, drawing inspiration from human-like reasoning strategies that emphasize structured knowledge reuse. In the first phase, semantically relevant knowledge structures are extracted from a sparse domain knowledge graph using a graph neural network and enriched with intrinsic large language model knowledge to resolve knowledge discrepancies. In the second phase, these threads are evaluated and pruned using a reward-guided strategy aimed at maintaining semantic coherence to generate effective reasoning threads. Experiments and expert evaluations show that ReT-Eval enhances user understanding and outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 1 figure, 6 tables</p></details> |

We model the occurrence of supply edges (firm i to firm j) as a non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP), using historical event counts to estimate the Poisson intensity function up to time t. However, forecasting future intensities is hindered by the limitations of historical data alone. To overcome this, we propose a novel Graph Double Exponential Smoothing (GDES) model, which integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with a nonparametric double exponential smoothing approach to predict the probability of future supply edge formations.Recognizing the interdependent economic dynamics between upstream and downstream firms, we assume that the Poisson intensity functions of supply edges are correlated, aligning with the non-homogeneous nature of the process.Our model is interpretable, decomposing intensity increments into contributions from the current edge's historical data and influences from neighboring edges in the supply chain network. Evaluated on a large-scale supply chain dataset with 87,969 firms, our approach achieves an AUC of 93.84 % in dynamic link prediction, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex supply chain interactions for accurate forecasting.</p></details> | 17 pages, 2 figures |
| **[OneForecast: A Universal Framework for Global and Regional Weather Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00338v3)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate weather forecasts are important for disaster prevention, agricultural planning, etc. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods offer physically interpretable high-accuracy predictions but are computationally expensive and fail to fully leverage rapidly growing historical data. In recent years, deep learning models have made significant progress in weather forecasting, but challenges remain, such as balancing global and regional high-resolution forecasts, excessive smoothing in extreme event predictions, and insufficient dynamic system modeling. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global-regional nested weather forecasting framework (OneForecast) based on graph neural networks. By combining a dynamic system perspective with multi-grid theory, we construct a multi-scale graph structure and densify the target region to capture local high-frequency features. We introduce an adaptive messaging mechanism, using dynamic gating units to deeply integrate node and edge features for more accurate extreme event forecasting. For high-resolution regional forecasts, we propose a neural nested grid method to mitigate boundary information loss. Experimental results show that OneForecast performs excellently across global to regional scales and short-term to long-term forecasts, especially in extreme event predictions.

Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds promise for developing objective, scalable, and timely diagnostic tools. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art AI methods for depression detection and diagnosis, based on a systematic review of 55 key studies. We introduce a novel hierarchical taxonomy that structures the field by primary clinical task (diagnosis vs. prediction), data modality (text, speech, neuroimaging, multimodal), and computational model class (e.g., graph neural networks, large language models, hybrid approaches). Our in-depth analysis reveals three major trends: the predominance of graph neural networks for modeling brain connectivity, the rise of large language models for linguistic and conversational data, and an emerging focus on multimodal fusion, explainability, and algorithmic fairness. Alongside methodological insights, we provide an overview of prominent public datasets and standard evaluation metrics as a practical guide for researchers. By synthesizing current advances and highlighting open challenges, this survey offers a comprehensive roadmap for future innovation in computational psychiatry.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRIDE: Structure and Embedding Distillation with Attention for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15938v2)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have led to increased model sizes to enhance their capacity and accuracy. Such large models incur high memory usage, latency, and computational costs, thereby restricting their inference deployment. GNN compression techniques compress large GNNs into smaller ones with negligible accuracy loss. One of the most promising compression techniques is knowledge distillation (KD). However, most KD approaches for GNNs only consider the outputs of the last layers and do not consider the outputs of the intermediate layers of the GNNs. The intermediate layers may contain important inductive biases indicated by the graph structure and embeddings. Ignoring these layers may lead to a high accuracy drop, especially when the compression ratio is high. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel KD approach for GNN compression that we call Structure and Embedding Distillation with Attention (STRIDE). STRIDE utilizes attention to identify important intermediate teacher-student layer pairs and focuses on using those pairs to align graph structure and node embeddings. We evaluate STRIDE on several datasets, such as OGBN-Mag and OGBN-Arxiv, using different model architectures, including GCNIIs, RGCNs, and GraphSAGE. On average, STRIDE achieves a 2.13% increase in accuracy with a 32.3X compression ratio on OGBN-Mag, a large graph dataset, compared to state-of-the-art approaches. On smaller datasets (e.g., Pubmed), STRIDE achieves up to a 141X compression ratio with the same accuracy as state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of focusing on intermediate-layer knowledge to obtain compact, accurate, and practical GNN models.</p></details> |  |

Previous work applied GNNs to image-derived graph representations for various downstream tasks such as classification or anomaly detection. These transformations include segmenting images, extracting features from segments, mapping them to nodes, and connecting them. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has rigorously compared the effectiveness of the numerous potential image-to-graph transformation approaches for GNN-based graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD). In this study, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of multiple segmentation schemes, edge construction strategies, and node feature sets based on color, texture, and shape descriptors to produce suitable image-derived graph representations to perform graph-level anomaly detection. We conduct extensive experiments on dermoscopic images using state-of-the-art GLAD models, examining performance and efficiency in purely unsupervised, weakly supervised, and fully supervised regimes. Our findings reveal, for example, that color descriptors contribute the best standalone performance, while incorporating shape and texture features consistently enhances detection efficacy. In particular, our best unsupervised configuration using OCGTL achieves a competitive AUC-ROC score of up to 0.805 without relying on pretrained backbones like comparable image-based approaches. With the inclusion of sparse labels, the performance increases substantially to 0.872 and with full supervision to 0.914 AUC-ROC.</p></details> |  |

With upgrades scheduled for the detectors of colliding-beam experiments around the world, and specifically at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, more collisions and more complex interactions are expected. This directly implies an increase in data produced and consequently in the computational resources needed to process them. At CERN, the amount of data produced is gargantuan. This is why the data have to be heavily filtered and selected in real time before being permanently stored. This data can then be used to perform physics analyses, in order to expand our current understanding of the universe and improve the Standard Model of physics. This real-time filtering, known as triggering, involves complex processing happening often at frequencies as high as 40 MHz. This thesis contributes to understanding how machine learning models can be efficiently deployed in such environments, in order to maximize throughput and minimize energy consumption. Inevitably, modern hardware designed for such tasks and contemporary algorithms are needed in order to meet the challenges posed by the stringent, high-frequency data rates. In this work, I present our graph neural network-based pipeline, developed for charged particle track reconstruction at the LHCb experiment at CERN. The pipeline was implemented end-to-end inside LHCb's first-level trigger, entirely on GPUs. Its performance was compared against the classical tracking algorithms currently in production at LHCb. The pipeline was also accelerated on the FPGA architecture, and its performance in terms of power consumption and processing speed was compared against the GPU implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD t...</summary><p>PhD thesis, Chapters 8 and 9 include results from work performed in collaboration with Anthony Correia</p></details> |
| **[Towards Faithful Class-level Self-explainability in Graph Neural Networks by Subgraph Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11513v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the interpretability of graph neural networks (GNNs) is crucial to ensure their safe and fair deployment. Recent work has introduced self-explainable GNNs that generate explanations as part of training, improving both faithfulness and efficiency. Some of these models, such as ProtGNN and PGIB, learn class-specific prototypes, offering a potential pathway toward class-level explanations. However, their evaluations focus solely on instance-level explanations, leaving open the question of whether these prototypes meaningfully generalize across instances of the same class. In this paper, we introduce GraphOracle, a novel self-explainable GNN framework designed to generate and evaluate class-level explanations for GNNs. Our model jointly learns a GNN classifier and a set of structured, sparse subgraphs that are discriminative for each class. We propose a novel integrated training that captures graph$\unicode{x2013}$subgraph$\unicode{x2013}$prediction dependencies efficiently and faithfully, validated through a masking-based evaluation strategy. This strategy enables us to retroactively assess whether prior methods like ProtGNN and PGIB deliver effective class-level explanations. Our results show that they do not. In contrast, GraphOracle achieves superior fidelity, explainability, and scalability across a range of graph classification tasks. We further demonstrate that GraphOracle avoids the computational bottlenecks of previous methods$\unicode{x2014}$like Monte Carlo Tree Search$\unicode{x2014}$by using entropy-regularized subgraph selection and lightweight random walk extraction, enabling faster and more scalable training. These findings position GraphOracle as a practical and principled solution for faithful class-level self-explainability in GNNs.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Discovering Invariant Neighborhood Patterns for Heterophilic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10572v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the problem of distribution shifts on non-homophilous graphs Mosting existing graph neural network methods rely on the homophilous assumption that nodes from the same class are more likely to be linked. However, such assumptions of homophily do not always hold in real-world graphs, which leads to more complex distribution shifts unaccounted for in previous methods. The distribution shifts of neighborhood patterns are much more diverse on non-homophilous graphs. We propose a novel Invariant Neighborhood Pattern Learning (INPL) to alleviate the distribution shifts problem on non-homophilous graphs. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive Neighborhood Propagation (ANP) module to capture the adaptive neighborhood information, which could alleviate the neighborhood pattern distribution shifts problem on non-homophilous graphs. We propose Invariant Non-Homophilous Graph Learning (INHGL) module to constrain the ANP and learn invariant graph representation on non-homophilous graphs. Extensive experimental results on real-world non-homophilous graphs show that INPL could achieve state-of-the-art performance for learning on large non-homophilous graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Sensory Cognitive Computing for Learning Population-level Brain Connectivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11436v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of connectional brain templates (CBTs) has recently garnered significant attention for its potential to identify unique connectivity patterns shared across individuals. However, existing methods for CBT learning such as conventional machine learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) are hindered by several limitations. These include: (i) poor interpretability due to their black-box nature, (ii) high computational cost, and (iii) an exclusive focus on structure and topology, overlooking the cognitive capacity of the generated CBT. To address these challenges, we introduce mCOCO (multi-sensory COgnitive COmputing), a novel framework that leverages Reservoir Computing (RC) to learn population-level functional CBT from BOLD (Blood-Oxygen-level-Dependent) signals. RC's dynamic system properties allow for tracking state changes over time, enhancing interpretability and enabling the modeling of brain-like dynamics, as demonstrated in prior literature. By integrating multi-sensory inputs (e.g., text, audio, and visual data), mCOCO captures not only structure and topology but also how brain regions process information and adapt to cognitive tasks such as sensory processing, all in a computationally efficient manner. Our mCOCO framework consists of two phases: (1) mapping BOLD signals into the reservoir to derive individual functional connectomes, which are then aggregated into a group-level CBT - an approach, to the best of our knowledge, not previously explored in functional connectivity studies - and (2) incorporating multi-sensory inputs through a cognitive reservoir, endowing the CBT with cognitive traits. Extensive evaluations show that our mCOCO-based template significantly outperforms GNN-based CBT in terms of centeredness, discriminativeness, topological soundness, and multi-sensory memory retention.

This is particularly evident when this task is tackled by graph neural networks, since they rely on an inherently local message passing scheme to learn the node representations that serve to cluster nodes into communities. In this work, we argue that the ability to propagate long-range information during message passing is key to effectively perform community detection in heterophilic graphs. To this end, we introduce the Unsupervised Antisymmetric Graph Neural Network (uAGNN), a novel unsupervised community detection approach leveraging non-dissipative dynamical systems to ensure stability and to propagate long-range information effectively. By employing antisymmetric weight matrices, uAGNN captures both local and global graph structures, overcoming the limitations posed by heterophilic scenarios. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate uAGNN's superior performance in high and medium heterophilic settings, where traditional methods fail to exploit long-range dependencies. These results highlight uAGNN's potential as a powerful tool for unsupervised community detection in diverse graph environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

However, many real-world systems, such as social or biological networks, exhibit complex interactions that are more naturally represented by higher-order topological domains. The emerging field of Geometric and Topological Deep Learning addresses this challenge by introducing methods that utilize and benefit from higher-order structures. Central to TDL is the concept of lifting, which transforms data representations from basic graph forms to more expressive topologies before the application of GNN models for learning. In this work, we propose a structural lifting strategy using Forman-Ricci curvature, which defines an edge-based network characteristic based on Riemannian geometry. Curvature reveals local and global properties of a graph, such as a network's backbones, i.e. coarse, structure-preserving graph geometries that form connections between major communities - most suitably represented as hyperedges to model information flows between clusters across large distances in the network. To this end, our approach provides a remedy to the problem of information distortion in message passing across long distances and graph bottlenecks - a phenomenon known in graph learning as over-squashing.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods suffer from three critical limitations: (1) they rely on homogeneous diffusion with static dynamics, limiting adaptability to diverse graph structures; (2) their depth is constrained by computational overhead and diminishing interpretability; and (3) theoretical understanding of their convergence behavior remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose GODNF, a Generalized Opinion Dynamics Neural Framework, which unifies multiple opinion dynamics models into a principled, trainable diffusion mechanism. Our framework captures heterogeneous diffusion patterns and temporal dynamics via node-specific behavior modeling and dynamic neighborhood influence, while ensuring efficient and interpretable message propagation even at deep layers. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating GODNF's ability to model diverse convergence configurations. Extensive empirical evaluations of node classification and influence estimation tasks confirm GODNF's superiority over state-of-the-art GNNs.</p></details> |  |

Traditional site planning often relies on experiential judgment and single-source data, limiting systematic quantification of multifunctional layouts. We propose a Site Planning Layout Indicator (SPLI) system, a data-driven framework integrating empirical knowledge with heterogeneous multi-source data to produce structured urban spatial information. The SPLI supports multimodal spatial data systems for analytics, inference, and retrieval by combining OpenStreetMap (OSM), Points of Interest (POI), building morphology, land use, and satellite imagery. It extends conventional metrics through five dimensions: (1) Hierarchical Building Function Classification, refining empirical systems into clear hierarchies; (2) Spatial Organization, quantifying seven layout patterns (e.g., symmetrical, concentric, axial-oriented); (3) Functional Diversity, transforming qualitative assessments into measurable indicators using Functional Ratio (FR) and Simpson Index (SI); (4) Accessibility to Essential Services, integrating facility distribution and transport networks for comprehensive accessibility metrics; and (5) Land Use Intensity, using Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and Building Coverage Ratio (BCR) to assess utilization efficiency. Data gaps are addressed through deep learning, including Relational Graph Neural Networks (RGNN) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Experiments show the SPLI improves functional classification accuracy and provides a standardized basis for automated, data-driven urban spatial analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 32 figures, submitted to Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science</p></details> |

In order to obtain an accurate, robust yet lightweight human pose estimator, one feasible way is to transfer pose knowledge from a powerful teacher model to a less-parameterized student model by knowledge distillation. However, the traditional knowledge distillation framework does not fully explore the contextual information among human joints. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage knowledge distillation framework for human pose estimation. In the first-stage distillation, we introduce the human joints structure loss to mine the structural information among human joints so as to transfer high-level semantic knowledge from the teacher model to the student model. In the second-stage distillation, we utilize an Image-Guided Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) to refine the initial human pose obtained from the first-stage distillation and supervise the training of the IGP-GCN in the progressive way by the final output pose of teacher model. The extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset: COCO keypoint and CrowdPose datasets, show that our proposed method performs favorably against lots of the existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods, especially for the more complex CrowdPose dataset, the performance improvement of our model is more significant.</p></details> |  |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in this domain by modeling rich structural dependencies in graph-based program representations such as control flow graphs (CFGs). However, single-model approaches may suffer from limited generalization and lack interpretability, especially in high-stakes security applications. In this paper, we propose a novel stacking ensemble framework for graph-based malware detection and explanation. Our method dynamically extracts CFGs from portable executable (PE) files and encodes their basic blocks through a two-step embedding strategy. A set of diverse GNN base learners, each with a distinct message-passing mechanism, is used to capture complementary behavioral features. Their prediction outputs are aggregated by a meta-learner implemented as an attention-based multilayer perceptron, which both classifies malware instances and quantifies the contribution of each base model. To enhance explainability, we introduce an ensemble-aware post-hoc explanation technique that leverages edge-level importance scores generated by a GNN explainer and fuses them using the learned attention weights. This produces interpretable, model-agnostic explanations aligned with the final ensemble decision. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves classification performance while providing insightful interpretations of malware behavior.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid development of graph neural networks (GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements. However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed, GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data, potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection. To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose \textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods.

To address the lack of explainability of GNNs on KGs, recent works extract Datalog rules from GNNs with provable correspondence guarantees. The extracted rules can be used to explain the GNN's predictions; furthermore, they can help characterise the expressive power of various GNN models. However, these works address only a form of link prediction based on a restricted, low-expressivity graph encoding/decoding method. In this paper, we consider a more general and popular approach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN output into fact predictions. We show how GNNs and scoring functions can be adapted to be monotonic, use the monotonicity to extract sound rules for explaining predictions, and leverage existing results about the kind of rules that scoring functions can capture. We also define procedures for obtaining equivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring functions. Our experiments show that, on link prediction benchmarks, monotonic GNNs and scoring functions perform well in practice and yield many sound rules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version (with appendices) of paper accepted to KR 2025 (22nd International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning)</p></details> |

We investigate a comprehensive class of Weisfeiler-Leman variants obtained by modifying the underlying logical framework and establish a precise theoretical characterization of their expressive power. We then test two selected variants on twelve benchmark datasets that span a range of different domains. The experiments demonstrate that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art graph neural networks and graph kernels while being more time or memory efficient, depending on the dataset. We also briefly discuss directly extracting interpretable modal logic formulas from graph datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Understanding of the Dynamics of Model Capacity in Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08052v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The stability-plasticity dilemma, closely related to a neural network's (NN) capacity-its ability to represent tasks-is a fundamental challenge in continual learning (CL). Within this context, we introduce CL's effective model capacity (CLEMC) that characterizes the dynamic behavior of the stability-plasticity balance point. We develop a difference equation to model the evolution of the interplay between the NN, task data, and optimization procedure. We then leverage CLEMC to demonstrate that the effective capacity-and, by extension, the stability-plasticity balance point is inherently non-stationary. We show that regardless of the NN architecture or optimization method, a NN's ability to represent new tasks diminishes when incoming task distributions differ from previous ones. We conduct extensive experiments to support our theoretical findings, spanning a range of architectures-from small feedforward network and convolutional networks to medium-sized graph neural networks and transformer-based large language models with millions of parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[GNN-based Unified Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10583v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical imaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts arise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient populations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need to train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to match local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures such as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may require non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for irregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models coherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability, remains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that encodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a shared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified models. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them through a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and knowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and distributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two MedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified learning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and tested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large distribution shifts.

| **[DiRW: Path-Aware Digraph Learning for Heterophily](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10320v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, graph neural network (GNN) has emerged as a powerful representation learning tool for graph-structured data. However, most approaches are tailored for undirected graphs, neglecting the abundant information in the edges of directed graphs (digraphs). In fact, digraphs are widely applied in the real world and confirmed to address heterophily challenges. Despite recent advancements, existing spatial- and spectral-based DiGNNs have limitations due to their complex learning mechanisms and reliance on high-quality topology, resulting in low efficiency and unstable performance. To address these issues, we propose Directed Random Walk (DiRW), a plug-and-play strategy for most spatial-based DiGNNs and also an innovative model which offers a new digraph learning paradigm. Specifically, it utilizes a direction-aware path sampler optimized from the perspectives of walk probability, length, and number in a weight-free manner by considering node profiles and topologies. Building upon this, DiRW incorporates a node-wise learnable path aggregator for generalized node representations. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that DiRW: (1) enhances most spatial-based methods as a plug-and-play strategy; (2) achieves SOTA performance as a new digraph learning paradigm. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/dhsiuu/DiRW.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphFedMIG: Tackling Class Imbalance in Federated Graph Learning via Mutual Information-Guided Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10471v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private, decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information, hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators. By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value, minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, their decision-making remains largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality, clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3) guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT, and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations. Repository: https://github.com/basiralab/X-Node.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influence Maximization in Multi-layer Social Networks Based on Differentiated Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10289v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying influential nodes is crucial in social network analysis. Existing methods often neglect local opinion leader tendencies, resulting in overlapping influence ranges for seed nodes. Furthermore, approaches based on vanilla graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle to effectively aggregate influence characteristics during message passing, particularly with varying influence intensities. Current techniques also fail to adequately address the multi-layer nature of social networks and node heterogeneity. To address these issues, this paper proposes Inf-MDE, a novel multi-layer influence maximization method leveraging differentiated graph embedding. Inf-MDE models social relationships using a multi-layer network structure. The model extracts a self-influence propagation subgraph to eliminate the representation bias between node embeddings and propagation dynamics. Additionally, Inf-MDE incorporates an adaptive local influence aggregation mechanism within its GNN design. This mechanism dynamically adjusts influence feature aggregation during message passing based on local context and influence intensity, enabling it to effectively capture both inter-layer propagation heterogeneity and intra-layer diffusion dynamics. Extensive experiments across four distinct multi-layer social network datasets demonstrate that Inf-MDE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a graph neural network-based OIQA framework that explicitly models structural relationships between viewports to enhance perception of spatial distortion non-uniformity. Our approach employs Fibonacci sphere sampling to generate viewports with well-structured topology, representing each as a graph node. Multi-stage feature extraction networks then derive high-dimensional node representation. To holistically capture spatial dependencies, we integrate a Graph Attention Network (GAT) modeling fine-grained local distortion variations among adjacent viewports, and a graph transformer capturing long-range quality interactions across distant regions. Extensive experiments on two large-scale OIQA databases with complex spatial distortions demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, confirming its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.</p></details> |  |

Many existing solutions rely on computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

We show that LVP is in PSPACE, for any reasonable activation functions. We provide a proof system.

Their expressive power is intimately related to logics that are invariant under graded bisimilarity. Current proposals for recurrent GNNs either assume that the graph size is given to the model, or suffer from a lack of termination guarantees. In this paper, we propose a halting mechanism for recurrent GNNs. We prove that our halting model can express all node classifiers definable in graded modal mu-calculus, even for the standard GNN variant that is oblivious to the graph size. To prove our main result, we develop a new approximate semantics for graded mu-calculus, which we believe to be of independent interest. We leverage this new semantics into a new model-checking algorithm, called the counting algorithm, which is oblivious to the graph size. In a final step we show that the counting algorithm can be implemented on a halting recurrent GNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended technical report of paper accepted for publication at KR 2025</p></details> |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are well suited to capture structural dependencies in process data, existing GNN-based PBPM models remain underdeveloped. Most rely either on short prefix subgraphs or global architectures that overlook temporal relevance and transition semantics. We propose a unified, interpretable GNN framework that advances the state of the art along three key axes. First, we compare prefix-based Graph Convolutional Networks(GCNs) and full trace Graph Attention Networks(GATs) to quantify the performance gap between localized and global modeling. Second, we introduce a novel time decay attention mechanism that constructs dynamic, prediction-centered windows, emphasizing temporally relevant history and suppressing noise. Third, we embed transition type semantics into edge features to enable fine grained reasoning over structurally ambiguous traces. Our architecture includes multilevel interpretability modules, offering diverse visualizations of attention behavior. Evaluated on five benchmarks, the proposed models achieve competitive Top-k accuracy and DL scores without per-dataset tuning. By addressing architectural, temporal, and semantic gaps, this work presents a robust, generalizable, and explainable solution for next event prediction in PBPM.</p></details> | 32 pages |
| **[Graph Neural Network and Transformer Integration for Unsupervised System Anomaly Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09401v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection method for distributed backend service systems, addressing practical challenges such as complex structural dependencies, diverse behavioral evolution, and the absence of labeled data. The method constructs a dynamic graph based on service invocation relationships and applies graph convolution to extract high-order structural representations from multi-hop topologies. A Transformer is used to model the temporal behavior of each node, capturing long-term dependencies and local fluctuations. During the feature fusion stage, a learnable joint embedding mechanism integrates structural and behavioral representations into a unified anomaly vector. A nonlinear mapping is then applied to compute anomaly scores, enabling an end-to-end detection process without supervision. Experiments on real-world cloud monitoring data include sensitivity analyses across different graph depths, sequence lengths, and data perturbations. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing models on several key metrics, demonstrating stronger expressiveness and stability in capturing anomaly propagation paths and modeling dynamic behavior sequences, with high potential for practical deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact Verification of Graph Neural Networks with Incremental Constraint Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09320v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes applications, such as fraud detection or healthcare, but are susceptible to adversarial attacks. A number of techniques have been proposed to provide adversarial robustness guarantees, but support for commonly used aggregation functions in message-passing GNNs is still lacking. In this paper, we develop an exact (sound and complete) verification method for GNNs to compute guarantees against attribute and structural perturbations that involve edge addition or deletion, subject to budget constraints. Focusing on node classification tasks, our method employs constraint solving with bound tightening, and iteratively solves a sequence of relaxed constraint satisfaction problems while relying on incremental solving capabilities of solvers to improve efficiency. We implement GNNev, a versatile solver for message-passing neural networks, which supports three aggregation functions, sum, max and mean, with the latter two considered here for the first time. Extensive experimental evaluation of GNNev on two standard benchmarks (Cora and CiteSeer) and two real-world fraud datasets (Amazon and Yelp) demonstrates its usability and effectiveness, as well as superior performance compared to existing {exact verification} tools on sum-aggregated node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Over-Squashing in GNNs and Causal Inference of Rewiring Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09265v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance across wide-range of domains such as recommender systems, material design, and drug repurposing. Yet message-passing GNNs suffer from over-squashing -- exponential compression of long-range information from distant nodes -- which limits expressivity. Rewiring techniques can ease this bottleneck; but their practical impacts are unclear due to the lack of a direct empirical over-squashing metric. We propose a rigorous, topology-focused method for assessing over-squashing between node pairs using the decay rate of their mutual sensitivity. We then extend these pairwise assessments to four graph-level statistics (prevalence, intensity, variability, extremity). Coupling these metrics with a within-graph causal design, we quantify how rewiring strategies affect over-squashing on diverse graph- and node-classification benchmarks. Our extensive empirical analyses show that most graph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing (but to various extents), and rewiring effectively mitigates it -- though the degree of mitigation, and its translation into performance gains, varies by dataset and method. We also found that over-squashing is less notable in node classification datasets, where rewiring often increases over-squashing, and performance variations are uncorrelated with over-squashing changes. These findings suggest that rewiring is most beneficial when over-squashing is both substantial and corrected with restraint -- while overly aggressive rewiring, or rewiring applied to minimally over-squashed graphs, is unlikely to help and may even harm performance. Our plug-and-play diagnostic tool lets practitioners decide -- before any training -- whether rewiring is likely to pay off.</p></details> | 14 pages, 2 figures |

The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the hard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural network techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or how the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's characteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large, structurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard accuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42 topological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph neural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input networks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform well on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random forest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with graph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends strongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle density, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that exploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks by selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables, 7 appendices</p></details> |

This work proposes a novel approach by combining Quantum Inspired Graph Neural Networks (QI-GNN) with flexibility of choice of an Ensemble Model using QBoost or a classic model such as Random Forrest Classifier. This system is tailored specifically for blockchain network analysis in anti-money laundering (AML) efforts. Our methodology to design this system incorporates a novel component, a Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition layer within the graph neural network framework, enhancing its capability to process and analyze complex data structures efficiently. Our technical approach has undergone rigorous evaluation against classical machine learning implementations, achieving an F2 score of 74.8% in detecting fraudulent transactions. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired techniques, supplemented by the structural advancements of the CP layer, to not only match but potentially exceed traditional methods in complex network analysis for financial security. The findings advocate for a broader adoption and further exploration of quantum-inspired algorithms within the financial sector to effectively combat fraud.</p></details> |  |

However, their widespread adoption and growing financial significance have attracted persistent and sophisticated threats, such as phishing campaigns and contract-level exploits. Traditional transaction-based threat detection methods often expose sensitive user data and interactions, raising privacy and security concerns. In response, static bytecode analysis has emerged as a proactive mitigation strategy, identifying malicious contracts before they execute harmful actions. Building on this approach, we introduced PhishingHook, the first machine-learning-based framework for detecting phishing activities in smart contracts via static bytecode and opcode analysis, achieving approximately 90% detection accuracy. Nevertheless, two pressing challenges remain: (1) the increasing use of sophisticated bytecode obfuscation techniques designed to evade static analysis, and (2) the heterogeneity of blockchain environments requiring platform-agnostic solutions. This paper presents a vision for ScamDetect (Smart Contract Agnostic Malware Detector), a robust, modular, and platform-agnostic framework for smart contract malware detection. Over the next 2.5 years, ScamDetect will evolve in two stages: first, by tackling obfuscated Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode through graph neural network (GNN) analysis of control flow graphs (CFGs), leveraging GNNs' ability to capture complex structural patterns beyond opcode sequences; and second, by generalizing detection capabilities to emerging runtimes such as WASM. ScamDetect aims to enable proactive, scalable security for the future of decentralized ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

However, obtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid information sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are available, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To address this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor Consistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated factors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During pre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it iteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels based on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to reduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based methods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In this work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent textual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability scoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by these auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label regimes, outperforming other baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

The iterative hybrid mechanism integrates the proposed Node-Destroyer Model, a machine learning hybrid model that utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such identifies and selects customer nodes to guide the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operator within the metaheuristic optimization frameworks. This model leverages the structural properties of the problem and solution that can be represented as a graph, to guide strategic selections concerning node removal. The proposed approach reduces operational complexity and scales down the search space involved in the optimization process. The hybrid approach is applied specifically to the CVRP and does not require retraining across problem instances of different sizes. The proposed hybrid mechanism is able to improve the performance of baseline metaheuristic algorithms. Our approach not only enhances the solution quality for standard CVRP benchmarks but also proves scalability on very large-scale instances with up to 30,000 customer nodes. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid mechanism is capable of improving different baseline algorithms, achieving better quality of solutions under similar settings.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |

Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that $\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced reasoning processes.</p></details> | IJCAI 2025 |

The main of our method is an edge solution selector model, which classifies solution edges to identify prohibited moves during the local search, hence guiding the search process within metaheuristic baselines. Two learning-based mechanisms are used to develop the edge selector: a simple tabular binary classifier and a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The tabular classifier employs Gradient Boosting Trees and Feedforward Neural Network as the baseline algorithms. Adjustments to the decision threshold are also applied to handle the class imbalance in the problem instance. An alternative mechanism employs the GNN to utilize graph structure for direct solution edge prediction, with the objective of guiding local search by predicting prohibited moves. These hybrid mechanisms are then applied in state-fo-the-art metaheuristic baselines. Our method demonstrates both scalability and generalizability, achieving performance improvements across different baseline metaheuristics, various problem sizes and variants, including the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and CVRP with Time Windows (CVRPTW). Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets up to 30,000 customer nodes, supported by pair-wise statistical analysis, verify the observed improvements.</p></details> | 29 pages, 12 figures |

However, jointly controlling both in real-time to alleviate traffic congestion presents new challenges, such as the inherent physical and behavioral heterogeneity between signal control and platooning, as well as coordination between them. This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale; 3) applying alternating optimization for training, allowing agents to update their own policies and adapt to other agents' policies. We evaluate our approach through SUMO simulations, which show convergent results in terms of both travel time and fuel consumption, and superior performance compared to other adaptive signal control methods.</p></details> |  |

These models are trained on fleet movement data, including robot positions, goals, and interactions, from hundreds of thousands of robots in Amazon warehouses worldwide. DeepFleet consists of four architectures that each embody a distinct inductive bias and collectively explore key points in the design space for multi-agent foundation models: the robot-centric (RC) model is an autoregressive decision transformer operating on neighborhoods of individual robots; the robot-floor (RF) model uses a transformer with cross-attention between robots and the warehouse floor; the image-floor (IF) model applies convolutional encoding to a multi-channel image representation of the full fleet; and the graph-floor (GF) model combines temporal attention with graph neural networks for spatial relationships. In this paper, we describe these models and present our evaluation of the impact of these design choices on prediction task performance. We find that the robot-centric and graph-floor models, which both use asynchronous robot state updates and incorporate the localized structure of robot interactions, show the most promise. We also present experiments that show that these two models can make effective use of larger warehouses operation datasets as the models are scaled up.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[UQGNN: Uncertainty Quantification of Graph Neural Networks for Multivariate Spatiotemporal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08551v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic, i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty, leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes), thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and (ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5% improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, SIGSPATIAL 2025</p></details> |

We introduce the Intersecting Block Graph (IBG), a low-rank factorization of large directed graphs based on combinations of intersecting bipartite components, each consisting of a pair of communities, for source and target nodes. By giving less weight to non-edges, we show how to efficiently approximate any graph, sparse or dense, by a dense IBG. Specifically, we prove a constructive version of the weak regularity lemma, showing that for any chosen accuracy, every graph, regardless of its size or sparsity, can be approximated by a dense IBG whose rank depends only on the accuracy. This dependence of the rank solely on the accuracy, and not on the sparsity level, is in contrast to previous forms of the weak regularity lemma. We present a graph neural network architecture operating on the IBG representation of the graph and demonstrating competitive performance on node classification, spatio-temporal graph analysis, and knowledge graph completion, while having memory and computational complexity linear in the number of nodes rather than edges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Diffusion-Based Model-Level Explanation of Heterogeneous GNNs with Node Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08458v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction. Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features (e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space, whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Through an extensive analysis of relevant studies, it is found that there is a lack of research work concerning algorithm selection oriented toward the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP). In this work, we propose a learning-based framework that integrates both traditional machine learning and graph neural networks to address this gap. We construct a labeled dataset by running four exact MCP algorithms on a diverse collection of graph instances, accompanied by structural and global statistical features extracted from each graph. We first evaluate four conventional classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), across multiple dataset variants. Experimental results show that RF consistently shows strong performance across metrics and dataset variants, making it a reliable baseline. In addition, feature importance analysis indicates that connectivity and topological structure are strong predictors of algorithm performance. Building on these findings, we develop a dual-channel model named GAT-MLP, which combines a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for local structural encoding with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for global feature modeling. The GAT-MLP model shows strong and consistent performance across all metrics. Our results highlight the effectiveness of dual-channel architectures and the promise of graph neural networks in combinatorial algorithm selection.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

However, extracting general chemical insight while balancing predictive accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture that combines compressed higher-order topological signals with standard molecular features. Our approach captures global geometric information while preserving computational tractability and human-interpretable structure. We evaluate our model across a range of benchmarks, from small-molecule datasets to complex material datasets, and demonstrate superior performance using a parameter-efficient architecture. We achieve the best performing results in both accuracy and robustness across almost all benchmarks. We open source all code \footnote{All code and results can be found on Github https://github.com/rahulkhorana/TFC-PACT-Net}.</p></details> |  |
| **[TLV-HGNN: Thinking Like a Vertex for Memory-efficient HGNN Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07796v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) excel at processing heterogeneous graph data and are widely applied in critical domains. In HGNN inference, the neighbor aggregation stage is the primary performance determinant, yet it suffers from two major sources of memory inefficiency. First, the commonly adopted per-semantic execution paradigm stores intermediate aggregation results for each semantic prior to semantic fusion, causing substantial memory expansion. Second, the aggregation process incurs extensive redundant memory accesses, including repeated loading of target vertex features across semantics and repeated accesses to shared neighbors due to cross-semantic neighborhood overlap. These inefficiencies severely limit scalability and reduce HGNN inference performance. In this work, we first propose a semantics-complete execution paradigm from a vertex perspective that eliminates per-semantic intermediate storage and redundant target vertex accesses. Building on this paradigm, we design TVL-HGNN, a reconfigurable hardware accelerator optimized for efficient aggregation. In addition, we introduce a vertex grouping technique based on cross-semantic neighborhood overlap, with hardware implementation, to reduce redundant accesses to shared neighbors. Experimental results demonstrate that TVL-HGNN achieves average speedups of 7.85x and 1.41x over the NVIDIA A100 GPU and the state-of-the-art HGNN accelerator HiHGNN, respectively, while reducing energy consumption by 98.79% and 32.61%.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, accepted by ICCD 2025</p></details> |

However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness -- some nodes are rich in information, while others remain sparse. Second, predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose Retrieval-augmented Graph Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph. ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings using a frozen LLM backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of agentic planning and local-global retrieval in graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, work in progress</p></details> |
| **[Discovering Spatial Correlations between Earth Observations in Global Atmospheric State Estimation by using Adaptive Graph Structure Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07659v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study aims to discover spatial correlations between Earth observations and atmospheric states to improve the forecasting accuracy of global atmospheric state estimation, which are usually conducted using conventional numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems and is the beginning of weather forecasting. NWP systems predict future atmospheric states at fixed locations, which are called NWP grid points, by analyzing previous atmospheric states and newly acquired Earth observations without fixed locations. Thus, surrounding meteorological context and the changing locations of the observations make spatial correlations between atmospheric states and observations over time. To handle complicated spatial correlations, which change dynamically, we employ spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) with structure learning. However, structure learning has an inherent limitation that this can cause structural information loss and over-smoothing problem by generating excessive edges. To solve this problem, we regulate edge sampling by adaptively determining node degrees and considering the spatial distances between NWP grid points and observations. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by using real-world atmospheric state and observation data from East Asia. Even in areas with high atmospheric variability, the proposed method outperformed existing STGNN models with and without structure learning.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Enhancing Egocentric Object Detection in Static Environments using Graph-based Spatial Anomaly Detection and Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07624v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world applications involving static environments, the spatial layout of objects remains consistent across instances. However, state-of-the-art object detection models often fail to leverage this spatial prior, resulting in inconsistent predictions, missed detections, or misclassifications, particularly in cluttered or occluded scenes. In this work, we propose a graph-based post-processing pipeline that explicitly models the spatial relationships between objects to correct detection anomalies in egocentric frames. Using a graph neural network (GNN) trained on manually annotated data, our model identifies invalid object class labels and predicts corrected class labels based on their neighbourhood context. We evaluate our approach both as a standalone anomaly detection and correction framework and as a post-processing module for standard object detectors such as YOLOv7 and RT-DETR. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating this spatial reasoning significantly improves detection performance, with mAP@50 gains of up to 4%. This method highlights the potential of leveraging the environment's spatial structure to improve reliability in object detection systems.</p></details> |  |

These problems often involve high-level task specifications, such as temporal logic or chance constraints, which require solving large-scale Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). However, existing MILP-based planning methods suffer from high computational cost and limited scalability, hindering their real-time applicability. We propose to use a neuro-symbolic approach to accelerate MILP-based motion planning by leveraging machine learning techniques to guide the solver's symbolic search. Focusing on two representative classes of planning problems, namely, those with Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications and those with chance constraints formulated via Conformal Predictive Programming (CPP). We demonstrate how graph neural network-based learning methods can guide traditional symbolic MILP solvers in solving challenging planning problems, including branching variable selection and solver parameter configuration. Through extensive experiments, we show that neuro-symbolic search techniques yield scalability gains. Our approach yields substantial improvements, achieving an average performance gain of about 20% over state-of-the-art solver across key metrics, including runtime and solution quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extracting Overlapping Microservices from Monolithic Code via Deep Semantic Embeddings and Graph Neural Network-Based Soft Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07486v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software systems are increasingly shifting from monolithic architectures to microservices to enhance scalability, maintainability, and deployment flexibility. Existing microservice extraction methods typically rely on hard clustering, assigning each software component to a single microservice. This approach often increases inter-service coupling and reduces intra-service cohesion. We propose Mo2oM (Monolithic to Overlapping Microservices), a framework that formulates microservice extraction as a soft clustering problem, allowing components to belong probabilistically to multiple microservices. This approach is inspired by expert-driven decompositions, where practitioners intentionally replicate certain software components across services to reduce communication overhead. Mo2oM combines deep semantic embeddings with structural dependencies extracted from methodcall graphs to capture both functional and architectural relationships. A graph neural network-based soft clustering algorithm then generates the final set of microservices. We evaluate Mo2oM on four open-source monolithic benchmarks and compare it against eight state-of-the-art baselines. Our results demonstrate that Mo2oM achieves improvements of up to 40.97% in structural modularity (balancing cohesion and coupling), 58% in inter-service call percentage (communication overhead), 26.16% in interface number (modularity and decoupling), and 38.96% in non-extreme distribution (service size balance) across all benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, the high dimensionality and complex interactions among omics layers present major challenges for predictive modeling. We propose Multi-Omics integration with Tree-generated Graph Neural Network (MOTGNN), a novel and interpretable framework for binary disease classification. MOTGNN employs eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to perform omics-specific supervised graph construction, followed by modality-specific Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for hierarchical representation learning, and a deep feedforward network for cross-omics integration. On three real-world disease datasets, MOTGNN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5-10% in accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score, and remains robust to severe class imbalance (e.g., 87.2% vs. 33.4% F1 on imbalanced data). The model maintains computational efficiency through sparse graphs (2.1-2.8 edges per node) and provides built-in interpretability, revealing both top-ranked biomarkers and the relative contributions of each omics modality. These results highlight MOTGNN's potential to improve both predictive accuracy and interpretability in multi-omics disease modeling.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[HSA-Net: Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Framework for Efficient and Scalable Molecular Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08334v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular representation learning, a cornerstone for downstream tasks like molecular captioning and molecular property prediction, heavily relies on Graph Neural Networks (GNN). However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem, where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network (HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP) module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bidirectional Hierarchical Protein Multi-Modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04770v2)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protein representation learning is critical for numerous biological tasks. Recently, large transformer-based protein language models (pLMs) pretrained on large scale protein sequences have demonstrated significant success in sequence-based tasks. However, pLMs lack structural context. Conversely, graph neural networks (GNNs) designed to leverage 3D structural information have shown promising generalization in protein-related prediction tasks, but their effectiveness is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled structural data. Recognizing that sequence and structural representations are complementary perspectives of the same protein entity, we propose a multimodal bidirectional hierarchical fusion framework to effectively merge these modalities. Our framework employs attention and gating mechanisms to enable effective interaction between pLMs-generated sequential representations and GNN-extracted structural features, improving information exchange and enhancement across layers of the neural network. This bidirectional and hierarchical (Bi-Hierarchical) fusion approach leverages the strengths of both modalities to capture richer and more comprehensive protein representations. Based on the framework, we further introduce local Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with gating and global Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with multihead self-attention approaches. Our method demonstrates consistent improvements over strong baselines and existing fusion techniques in a variety of protein representation learning benchmarks, including enzyme EC classification, model quality assessment, protein-ligand binding affinity prediction, protein-protein binding site prediction, and B cell epitopes prediction. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art for multimodal protein representation learning, emphasizing the efficacy of Bi-Hierarchical Fusion in bridging sequence and structural modalities.</p></details> |  |

A theory-driven GNN with seven functional nodes was built. Performance was evaluated via intra-subject (80/20 split) and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSOCV). GNNExplainer was used for interpretability.Results: The model achieved high intra-subject accuracy (>85%) and significantly above-chance cross-subject performance (approximately73.7%). Explainability analysis revealed a key finding: during NSSI states, a critical feedback loop regulating somatic sensation exhibits dysfunction and directional reversal. Specifically, the brain loses its ability to self-correct via negative bodily feedback, and the regulatory mechanism enters an "ineffective idling" state.Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of applying theory-guided GNNs to sparse, single-channel EEG for decoding complex mental states. The identified "feedback loop reversal" offers a novel, dynamic, and computable model of NSSI mechanisms, paving the way for objective biomarkers and next-generation Digital Therapeutics (DTx).</p></details> |  |

The method abstracts system states at different time slices into a sequence of graph structures. It integrates the runtime features of service nodes with the invocation relationships among services to construct a unified spatiotemporal modeling framework. The model first applies a graph convolutional network to extract high-order dependency information from the service topology. Then it uses a gated recurrent network to capture the dynamic evolution of performance metrics over time. A time encoding mechanism is also introduced to enhance the model's ability to represent non-stationary temporal sequences. The architecture is trained in an end-to-end manner, optimizing the multi-layer nested structure to achieve high-precision regression of future service performance metrics. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a large-scale public cluster dataset is used. A series of multi-dimensional experiments are designed, including variations in time windows and concurrent load levels. These experiments comprehensively evaluate the model's predictive performance and stability. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms existing representative methods across key metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R2. It maintains strong robustness under varying load intensities and structural complexities. These results demonstrate the model's practical potential for backend service performance management tasks.</p></details> |  |

GNNs are not inherently interpretable and thus, many explanation methods have been proposed. However, existing explanation methods often struggle to generate interpretable, fine-grained rationales, especially when node attributes include rich natural language. In this work, we introduce LOGIC, a lightweight, post-hoc framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate faithful and interpretable explanations for GNN predictions. LOGIC projects GNN node embeddings into the LLM embedding space and constructs hybrid prompts that interleave soft prompts with textual inputs from the graph structure. This enables the LLM to reason about GNN internal representations and produce natural language explanations along with concise explanation subgraphs. Our experiments across four real-world TAG datasets demonstrate that LOGIC achieves a favorable trade-off between fidelity and sparsity, while significantly improving human-centric metrics such as insightfulness. LOGIC sets a new direction for LLM-based explainability in graph learning by aligning GNN internals with human reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

These functional connectivity dynamics may be related to behaviour and neuropsychiatric disease. To model these dynamics, temporal brain connectivity representations are essential, as they reflect evolving interactions between brain regions and provide insight into transient neural states and network reconfigurations. However, conventional graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies in dynamic fMRI data. To address this challenge, we propose BrainATCL, an unsupervised, nonparametric framework for adaptive temporal brain connectivity learning, enabling functional link prediction and age estimation. Our method dynamically adjusts the lookback window for each snapshot based on the rate of newly added edges. Graph sequences are subsequently encoded using a GINE-Mamba2 backbone to learn spatial-temporal representations of dynamic functional connectivity in resting-state fMRI data of 1,000 participants from the Human Connectome Project. To further improve spatial modeling, we incorporate brain structure and function-informed edge attributes, i.e., the left/right hemispheric identity and subnetwork membership of brain regions, enabling the model to capture biologically meaningful topological patterns. We evaluate our BrainATCL on two tasks: functional link prediction and age estimation. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance and strong generalization, including in cross-session prediction scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, this task remains challenging due to low contrast with surrounding mucosa, specular highlights, and indistinct boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose FOCUS-Med, which stands for Fusion of spatial and structural graph with attentional context-aware polyp segmentation in endoscopic medical imaging. FOCUS-Med integrates a Dual Graph Convolutional Network (Dual-GCN) module to capture contextual spatial and topological structural dependencies. This graph-based representation enables the model to better distinguish polyps from background tissues by leveraging topological cues and spatial connectivity, which are often obscured in raw image intensities. It enhances the model's ability to preserve boundaries and delineate complex shapes typical of polyps. In addition, a location-fused stand-alone self-attention is employed to strengthen global context integration. To bridge the semantic gap between encoder-decoder layers, we incorporate a trainable weighted fast normalized fusion strategy for efficient multi-scale aggregation. Notably, we are the first to introduce the use of a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide detailed qualitative evaluations of segmentation quality. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that FOCUS-Med achieves state-of-the-art performance across five key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness and clinical potential for AI-assisted colonoscopy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript under review</p></details> |

However, existing spiking GNNs predominantly operate in Euclidean space and rely on fixed geometric assumptions, limiting their capacity to model complex graph structures such as hierarchies and cycles. To overcome these limitations, we propose \method{}, a novel Geometry-Aware Spiking Graph Neural Network that unifies spike-based neural dynamics with adaptive representation learning on Riemannian manifolds. \method{} features three key components: a Riemannian Embedding Layer that projects node features into a pool of constant-curvature manifolds, capturing non-Euclidean structures; a Manifold Spiking Layer that models membrane potential evolution and spiking behavior in curved spaces via geometry-consistent neighbor aggregation and curvature-based attention; and a Manifold Learning Objective that enables instance-wise geometry adaptation through jointly optimized classification and link prediction losses defined over geodesic distances. All modules are trained using Riemannian SGD, eliminating the need for backpropagation through time. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that GSG achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and energy efficiency compared to both Euclidean SNNs and manifold-based GNNs, establishing a new paradigm for curvature-aware, energy-efficient graph learning.</p></details> |  |

While traditional Machine Learning (ML) models operating on tabular data have shown promise, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a potential advantage by capturing complex relationships inherent in student data if structured as graphs. This paper investigates whether transforming tabular student data into graph structures, primarily using clustering techniques, enhances dropout prediction accuracy. We compare the performance of GNNs (a custom Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and GraphSAGE) on these generated graphs against established tabular models (Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and TabNet) using a real-world student dataset. Our experiments explore various graph construction strategies based on different clustering algorithms (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction techniques (Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)). Our findings demonstrate that a specific GNN configuration, GraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, achieved superior performance, notably improving the macro F1-score by approximately 7 percentage points and accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points over the strongest tabular baseline (XGBoost). However, other GNN configurations and graph construction methods did not consistently surpass tabular models, emphasizing the critical role of the graph generation strategy and GNN architecture selection. This highlights both the potential of GNNs and the challenges in optimally transforming tabular data for graph-based learning in this domain.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Mitigating Distribution Shift in Graph-Based Android Malware Classification via Function Metadata and LLM Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06734v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based malware classifiers can achieve over 94% accuracy on standard Android datasets, yet we find they suffer accuracy drops of up to 45% when evaluated on previously unseen malware variants from the same family - a scenario where strong generalization would typically be expected. This highlights a key limitation in existing approaches: both the model architectures and their structure-only representations often fail to capture deeper semantic patterns. In this work, we propose a robust semantic enrichment framework that enhances function call graphs with contextual features, including function-level metadata and, when available, code embeddings derived from large language models. The framework is designed to operate under real-world constraints where feature availability is inconsistent, and supports flexible integration of semantic signals. To evaluate generalization under realistic domain and temporal shifts, we introduce two new benchmarks: MalNet-Tiny-Common and MalNet-Tiny-Distinct, constructed using malware family partitioning to simulate cross-family generalization and evolving threat behavior. Experiments across multiple graph neural network backbones show that our method improves classification performance by up to 8% under distribution shift and consistently enhances robustness when integrated with adaptation-based methods. These results offer a practical path toward building resilient malware detection systems in evolving threat environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 7 tables, under review</p></details> |
| **[Transferring Social Network Knowledge from Multiple GNN Teachers to Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06663v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown strong performance on graph-structured data, but their reliance on graph connectivity often limits scalability and efficiency. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a recent architecture with learnable univariate functions, offer strong nonlinear expressiveness and efficient inference. In this work, we integrate KANs into three popular GNN architectures-GAT, SGC, and APPNP-resulting in three new models: KGAT, KSGC, and KAPPNP. We further adopt a multi-teacher knowledge amalgamation framework, where knowledge from multiple KAN-based GNNs is distilled into a graph-independent KAN student model. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed models improve node classification accuracy, and the knowledge amalgamation approach significantly boosts student model performance. Our findings highlight the potential of KANs for enhancing GNN expressiveness and for enabling efficient, graph-free inference.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 tables |
