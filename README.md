While existing methods have shown promise in unconditional single-domain TSG, real-world applications demand for cross-domain approaches capable of controlled generation tailored to domain-specific constraints and instance-level requirements. In this paper, we argue that text can provide semantic insights, domain information and instance-specific temporal patterns, to guide and improve TSG. We introduce ``Text-Controlled TSG'', a task focused on generating realistic time series by incorporating textual descriptions. To address data scarcity in this setting, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework that synthesizes diverse, realistic text-to-TS datasets. Furthermore, we introduce BRIDGE, a hybrid text-controlled TSG framework that integrates semantic prototypes with text description for supporting domain-level guidance. This approach achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity on 11 of 12 datasets, and improves controllability by up to 12% on MSE and 6% MAE compared to no text input generation, highlighting its potential for generating tailored time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[BEDTime: A Unified Benchmark for Automatically Describing Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05215v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many recent studies have proposed general-purpose foundation models designed for a variety of time series analysis tasks. While several established datasets already exist for evaluating these models, previous works frequently introduce their models in conjunction with new datasets, limiting opportunities for direct, independent comparisons and obscuring insights into the relative strengths of different methods. Additionally, prior evaluations often cover numerous tasks simultaneously, assessing a broad range of model abilities without clearly pinpointing which capabilities contribute to overall performance. To address these gaps, we formalize and evaluate 3 tasks that test a model's ability to describe time series using generic natural language: (1) recognition (True/False question-answering), (2) differentiation (multiple choice question-answering), and (3) generation (open-ended natural language description). We then unify 4 recent datasets to enable head-to-head model comparisons on each task. Experimentally, in evaluating 13 state-of-the-art language, vision--language, and time series--language models, we find that (1) popular language-only methods largely underperform, indicating a need for time series-specific architectures, (2) VLMs are quite successful, as expected, identifying the value of vision models for these tasks and (3) pretrained multimodal time series--language models successfully outperform LLMs, but still have significant room for improvement. We also find that all approaches exhibit clear fragility in a range of robustness tests. Overall, our benchmark provides a standardized evaluation on a task necessary for time series reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Causality for Enhanced Prediction of Web Traffic Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00612v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting web service traffic has significant social value, as it can be applied to various practical scenarios, including but not limited to dynamic resource scaling, load balancing, system anomaly detection, service-level agreement compliance, and fraud detection. Web service traffic is characterized by frequent and drastic fluctuations over time and are influenced by heterogeneous web user behaviors, making accurate prediction a challenging task. Previous research has extensively explored statistical approaches, and neural networks to mine features from preceding service traffic time series for prediction. However, these methods have largely overlooked the causal relationships between services. Drawing inspiration from causality in ecological systems, we empirically recognize the causal relationships between web services. To leverage these relationships for improved web service traffic prediction, we propose an effective neural network module, CCMPlus, designed to extract causal relationship features across services. This module can be seamlessly integrated with existing time series models to consistently enhance the performance of web service traffic predictions. We theoretically justify that the causal correlation matrix generated by the CCMPlus module captures causal relationships among services. Empirical results on real-world datasets from Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Group, and Ant Group confirm that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for predicting service traffic time series. These findings highlight the efficacy of leveraging causal relationships for improved predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>time ...</summary><p>time series, web service, web traffic, causality, more experiments</p></details> |
| **[Tail-robust factor modelling of vector and tensor time series in high dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09390v4)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of factor modelling vector- and tensor-valued time series in the presence of heavy tails in the data, which produce extreme observations with non-negligible probability. We propose to combine a two-step procedure for tensor decomposition with data truncation, which is easy to implement and does not require an iterative search for a numerical solution. Departing away from the light-tail assumptions often adopted in the time series factor modelling literature, we derive the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators while assuming the existence of the $(2 + 2\epsilon)$-th moment only for some $\epsilon \in (0, 1)$. Our rates explicitly depend on $\eps$ characterising the effect of heavy tails, and on the chosen level of truncation. We also propose a consistent criterion for determining the number of factors. Simulation studies and applications to two macroeconomic datasets demonstrate the good performance of the proposed estimators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamics of Liquidity Surfaces in Uniswap v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05013v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a comprehensive study on the empirical dynamics of Uniswap v3 liquidity, which we model as a time-tick surface, $L_t(x)$. Using a combination of functional principal component analysis (FPCA) and dynamic factor methods, we analyze three distinct pools over multiple sample periods. Our findings offer three main contributions: a statistical characterization of automated market maker liquidity, an interpretable and portable basis for dimension reduction, and a robust analysis of liquidity dynamics using rolling window metrics. For the 5 bps pools, the leading empirical eigenfunctions explain the majority of cross-tick variation and remain stable, aligning closely with a low-order Legendre polynomial basis. This alignment provides a parsimonious and interpretable structure, similar to the dynamic Nelson-Siegel method for yield curves. The factor coefficients exhibit a time series structure well-captured by AR(1) models with clear GARCH-type heteroskedasticity and heavy-tailed innovations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-Supervised Bayesian GANs with Log-Signatures for Uncertainty-Aware Credit Card Fraud Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00931v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel deep generative semi-supervised framework for credit card fraud detection, formulated as time series classification task. As financial transaction data streams grow in scale and complexity, traditional methods often require large labeled datasets, struggle with time series of irregular sampling frequencies and varying sequence lengths. To address these challenges, we extend conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for targeted data augmentation, integrate Bayesian inference to obtain predictive distributions and quantify uncertainty, and leverage log-signatures for robust feature encoding of transaction histories. We introduce a novel Wasserstein distance-based loss to align generated and real unlabeled samples while simultaneously maximizing classification accuracy on labeled data. Our approach is evaluated on the BankSim dataset, a widely used simulator for credit card transaction data, under varying proportions of labeled samples, demonstrating consistent improvements over benchmarks in both global statistical and domain-specific metrics. These findings highlight the effectiveness of GAN-driven semi-supervised learning with log-signatures for irregularly sampled time series and emphasize the importance of uncertainty-aware predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated references in v2</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Law for Large-Scale Pre-Training Using Chaotic Time Series and Predictability in Financial Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04921v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making processes across diverse fields including meteorology, traffic, electricity, economics, finance, and so on. Especially, predicting returns on financial instruments is a challenging problem. Some researchers have proposed time series foundation models applicable to various forecasting tasks. Simultaneously, based on the recognition that real-world time series exhibit chaotic properties, methods have been developed to artificially generate synthetic chaotic time series, construct diverse datasets and train models. In this study, we propose a methodology for modeling financial time series by generating artificial chaotic time series and applying resampling techniques to simulate financial time series data, which we then use as training samples. Increasing the resampling interval to extend predictive horizons, we conducted large-scale pre-training using 10 billion training samples for each case. We subsequently created test datasets for multiple timeframes using actual Bitcoin trade data and performed zero-shot prediction without re-training the pre-trained model. The results of evaluating the profitability of a simple trading strategy based on these predictions demonstrated significant performance improvements over autocorrelation models. During the large-scale pre-training process, we observed a scaling law-like phenomenon that we can achieve predictive performance at a certain level with extended predictive horizons for chaotic time series by increasing the number of training samples exponentially. If this scaling law proves robust and holds true across various chaotic models, it suggests the potential to predict near-future events by investing substantial computational resources. Future research should focus on further large-scale training and verifying the applicability of this scaling law to diverse chaotic models.</p></details> | Patent pending |
| **[VARMA-Enhanced Transformer for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04782v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting. Recent work, like the Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS), shows that removing self-attention can make the model more accurate and efficient. However, these streamlined architectures may overlook the fine-grained, local temporal dependencies effectively captured by classical statistical models like Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average model (VARMA). To address this gap, we propose VARMAformer, a novel architecture that synergizes the efficiency of a cross-attention-only framework with the principles of classical time series analysis. Our model introduces two key innovations: (1) a dedicated VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models autoregressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) patterns at the patch level, and (2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism that employs a temporal gate to make queries more context-aware. By fusing these classical insights into a modern backbone, VARMAformer captures both global, long-range dependencies and local, statistical structures. Through extensive experiments on widely-used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work validates the significant benefit of integrating classical statistical insights into modern deep learning frameworks for time series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>The P...</summary><p>The Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence - PRICAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Echoes Before Collapse: Deep Learning Detection of Flickering in Complex Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04683v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning offers powerful tools for anticipating tipping points in complex systems, yet its potential for detecting flickering (noise-driven switching between coexisting stable states) remains unexplored. Flickering is a hallmark of reduced resilience in climate systems, ecosystems, financial markets, and other systems. It can precede critical regime shifts that are highly impactful but difficult to predict. Here we show that convolutional long short-term memory (CNN LSTM) models, trained on synthetic time series generated from simple polynomial functions with additive noise, can accurately identify flickering patterns. Despite being trained on simplified dynamics, our models generalize to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detect flickering in empirical datasets, including dormouse body temperature records and palaeoclimate proxies from the African Humid Period. These findings demonstrate that deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy, nonlinear time series, providing a flexible framework for identifying instability across a wide range of dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Applying non-negative matrix factorization with covariates to multivariate time series data as a vector autoregression model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17446v3)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for analyzing multivariate time series (MTS) data by integrating non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with vector autoregression (VAR). Termed NMF-VAR, this method models the coefficient matrix of NMF as a VAR process, enabling simultaneous extraction of latent components and temporal dependencies. Unlike standard VAR, which struggles with high dimensionality and lacks clarity, our method introduces a low-rank latent structure that reduces the number of parameters while retaining explanatory power. The proposed framework generalizes the standard VAR model to high-dimensional non-negative data, including the standard VAR as a special case. We formulate the estimation as a constrained optimization problem and present multiplicative update rules for NMF based on existing tri-factorization techniques. We evaluate the method on three real-world datasets: quarterly first-differenced macroeconomic indicators of Canada, monthly international airline passenger volumes, and daily COVID-19 infection counts across Japanese prefectures. The results demonstrate that NMF-VAR effectively captures meaningful patterns such as economic cycles, seasonal travel behavior, and regional epidemic trends. Moreover, the method yields a significant reduction in regression parameters, improving both scalability and model transparency. Overall, NMF-VAR provides an efficient and insightful tool for analyzing high-dimensional and large-scale time series data.</p></details> | 10 figures |
| **[Continuum Attention for Neural Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06486v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers, and the attention mechanism in particular, have become ubiquitous in machine learning. Their success in modeling nonlocal, long-range correlations has led to their widespread adoption in natural language processing, computer vision, and time series problems. Neural operators, which map spaces of functions into spaces of functions, are necessarily both nonlinear and nonlocal if they are universal; it is thus natural to ask whether the attention mechanism can be used in the design of neural operators. Motivated by this, we study transformers in the function space setting. We formulate attention as a map between infinite dimensional function spaces and prove that the attention mechanism as implemented in practice is a Monte Carlo or finite difference approximation of this operator. The function space formulation allows for the design of transformer neural operators, a class of architectures designed to learn mappings between function spaces. In this paper, we state and prove the first universal approximation result for transformer neural operators, using only a slight modification of the architecture implemented in practice. The prohibitive cost of applying the attention operator to functions defined on multi-dimensional domains leads to the need for more efficient attention-based architectures. For this reason we also introduce a function space generalization of the patching strategy from computer vision, and introduce a class of associated neural operators. Numerical results, on an array of operator learning problems, demonstrate the promise of our approaches to function space formulations of attention and their use in neural operators.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChronoGraph: A Real-World Graph-Based Multivariate Time Series Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04449v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ChronoGraph, a graph-structured multivariate time series forecasting dataset built from real-world production microservices. Each node is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware evaluation in microservice systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[History matching for functional data and its application to tsunami warnings in the Indian Ocean](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04342v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional History Matching (HM) identifies implausible regions of the input parameter space by comparing scalar outputs of a computer model to observations. It offers higher computational efficiency than Bayesian calibration, making it suitable for high-dimensional problems. However, in real physical systems, outputs are often functional, such as time series or spatial fields, and conventional HM cannot fully exploit such information. We propose a novel method, Functional History Matching (FHM), which extends HM to handle functional data. FHM incorporates the Outer Product Emulator, an extension of the Gaussian Process emulator designed for time series, to enhance computational efficiency. FHM also leverages Random Projection to extract dynamic features from infinite-dimensional data, including derivatives. FHM supports uncertainty quantification essential for decision-making and naturally accommodates model discrepancies. To demonstrate its practical effectiveness, we apply FHM to a synthetic tsunami forecasting scenario in the Indian Ocean, assuming a realistic event in the Makran subduction zone. Wave elevation time series from offshore buoy data are used to predict wave elevations over the Indian coastline. Our results show that FHM significantly outperforms scalar-based HM in accuracy. FHM enables reliable forecasting from functional data within feasible computational constraints, offering a robust framework for early warning systems and beyond.</p></details> | 56 pages, 20 figures |
| **[One-Embedding-Fits-All: Efficient Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasting by a Model Zoo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04208v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly advanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths. ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks. Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy Risks in Time Series Forecasting: User- and Record-Level Membership Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04169v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether specific data were used to train a model. While extensively studied on classification models, their impact on time series forecasting remains largely unexplored. We address this gap by introducing two new attacks: (i) an adaptation of multivariate LiRA, a state-of-the-art MIA originally developed for classification models, to the time-series forecasting setting, and (ii) a novel end-to-end learning approach called Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. We benchmark these methods against adapted versions of other leading attacks from the classification setting. We evaluate all attacks in realistic settings on the TUH-EEG and ELD datasets, targeting two strong forecasting architectures, LSTM and the state-of-the-art N-HiTS, under both record- and user-level threat models. Our results show that forecasting models are vulnerable, with user-level attacks often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods achieve the strongest performance in several settings, establishing new baselines for privacy risk assessment in time series forecasting. Furthermore, vulnerability increases with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, echoing trends observed in large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[i-Mask: An Intelligent Mask for Breath-Driven Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04544v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The patterns of inhalation and exhalation contain important physiological signals that can be used to anticipate human behavior, health trends, and vital parameters. Human activity recognition (HAR) is fundamentally connected to these vital signs, providing deeper insights into well-being and enabling real-time health monitoring. This work presents i-Mask, a novel HAR approach that leverages exhaled breath patterns captured using a custom-developed mask equipped with integrated sensors. Data collected from volunteers wearing the mask undergoes noise filtering, time-series decomposition, and labeling to train predictive models. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving over 95\% accuracy and highlighting its potential in healthcare and fitness applications.</p></details> | 18 Pages, 10 Figures |
| **[Probabilistic QoS Metric Forecasting in Delay-Tolerant Networks Using Conditional Diffusion Models on Latent Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08821v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active QoS metric prediction, commonly employed in the maintenance and operation of DTN, could enhance network performance regarding latency, throughput, energy consumption, and dependability. Naturally formulated as a multivariate time series forecasting problem, it attracts substantial research efforts. Traditional mean regression methods for time series forecasting cannot capture the data complexity adequately, resulting in deteriorated performance in operational tasks in DTNs such as routing. This paper formulates the prediction of QoS metrics in DTN as a probabilistic forecasting problem on multivariate time series, where one could quantify the uncertainty of forecasts by characterizing the distribution of these samples. The proposed approach hires diffusion models and incorporates the latent temporal dynamics of non-stationary and multi-mode data into them. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach by showing that it outperforms the popular probabilistic time series forecasting methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial disaggregation of time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04065v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal modeling of economic aggregates is increasingly relevant in regional science due to the presence of both spatial spillovers and temporal dynamics. Traditional temporal disaggregation methods, such as Chow-Lin, often ignore spatial dependence, potentially losing important regional information. We propose a novel methodology for spatiotemporal disaggregation, integrating spatial autoregressive models, benchmarking restrictions, and auxiliary covariates. The approach accommodates partially observed regional data through an anchoring mechanism, ensuring consistency with known aggregates while reducing prediction variance. We establish identifiability and asymptotic normality of the estimator under general conditions, including non-Gaussian and heteroskedastic residuals. Extensive simulations confirm the method's robustness across a wide range of spatial autocorrelations and covariate informativeness. The methodology is illustrated by disaggregating Spanish GDP into 17 autonomous communities from 2002 to 2023, using auxiliary indicators and principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction. This framework extends classical temporal disaggregation to the spatial domain, providing accurate regional estimates while accounting for spatial spillovers and irregular data availability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Generative Models Meet Compressed Sensing, with Applications to Image Data and Financial Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03898v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops dimension reduction techniques for accelerating diffusion model inference in the context of synthetic data generation. The idea is to integrate compressed sensing into diffusion models: (i) compress the data into a latent space, (ii) train a diffusion model in the latent space, and (iii) apply a compressed sensing algorithm to the samples generated in the latent space, facilitating the efficiency of both model training and inference. Under suitable sparsity assumptions on data, the proposed algorithm is proved to enjoy faster convergence by combining diffusion model inference with sparse recovery. As a byproduct, we obtain an optimal value for the latent space dimension. We also conduct numerical experiments on a range of datasets, including image data (handwritten digits, medical images, and climate data) and financial time series for stress testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reduce-Rank Matrix Integer-Valued Autoregressive Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03338v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integer-valued time series are widely present in many fields, such as finance, economics, disease transmission, and traffic flow. With data dimensions surging, the traditional multivariate generalized integer autoregressive (MGINAR) model faces parameter overload, poor interpretability, and structural information loss. Matrix integer-valued autoregression (MINAR) model captures row-column cross-correlations and reduces the number of parameters to be estimated. However, further growth in dimensionality causes data redundancy, which degrades the MINAR model's performance and increases the number of parameters. To solve the limitations of the MINAR model described above, this paper proposes the reduced-rank matrix integer-valued autoregression (RRMINAR) model. Reducing rank is achieved by adding low-rank constraints to the coefficient matrices in the MINAR model, leading to RRMINAR reducing parameter quantity while incorporating matrix structure information. We develop an iterative conditional least squares estimation and analyze its asymptotic properties. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RRMINAR model exhibits more robust parameter estimation and higher prediction accuracy than MGINAR and MINAR models when the data structure is low-rank. Empirical analysis using criminal data validates the proposed RRMINAR model's effectiveness and uncovers structural temporal-spatial information in criminal behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[MillGNN: Learning Multi-Scale Lead-Lag Dependencies for Multi-Variate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03852v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-variate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for various applications. Existing methods have shown promising results owing to their strong ability to capture intra- and inter-variate dependencies. However, these methods often overlook lead-lag dependencies at multiple grouping scales, failing to capture hierarchical lead-lag effects in complex systems. To this end, we propose MillGNN, a novel \underline{g}raph \underline{n}eural \underline{n}etwork-based method that learns \underline{m}ult\underline{i}ple grouping scale \underline{l}ead-\underline{l}ag dependencies for MTS forecasting, which can comprehensively capture lead-lag effects considering variate-wise and group-wise dynamics and decays. Specifically, MillGNN introduces two key innovations: (1) a scale-specific lead-lag graph learning module that integrates cross-correlation coefficients and dynamic decaying features derived from real-time inputs and time lags to learn lead-lag dependencies for each scale, which can model evolving lead-lag dependencies with statistical interpretability and data-driven flexibility; (2) a hierarchical lead-lag message passing module that passes lead-lag messages at multiple grouping scales in a structured way to simultaneously propagate intra- and inter-scale lead-lag effects, which can capture multi-scale lead-lag effects with a balance of comprehensiveness and efficiency. Experimental results on 11 datasets demonstrate the superiority of MillGNN for long-term and short-term MTS forecasting, compared with 16 state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Online time series prediction using feature adjustment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03810v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is of significant importance across various domains. However, it faces significant challenges due to distribution shift. This issue becomes particularly pronounced in online deployment scenarios where data arrives sequentially, requiring models to adapt continually to evolving patterns. Current time series online learning methods focus on two main aspects: selecting suitable parameters to update (e.g., final layer weights or adapter modules) and devising suitable update strategies (e.g., using recent batches, replay buffers, or averaged gradients). We challenge the conventional parameter selection approach, proposing that distribution shifts stem from changes in underlying latent factors influencing the data. Consequently, updating the feature representations of these latent factors may be more effective. To address the critical problem of delayed feedback in multi-step forecasting (where true values arrive much later than predictions), we introduce ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in Z-space). ADAPT-Z utilizes an adapter module that leverages current feature representations combined with historical gradient information to enable robust parameter updates despite the delay. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard base models without adaptation and surpasses state-of-the-art online learning approaches across multiple datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/xiannanhuang/ADAPT-Z.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long Input Sequence Network for Long Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15869v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Short fixed-length inputs are the main bottleneck of deep learning methods in long time-series forecasting tasks. Prolonging input length causes overfitting, rapidly deteriorating accuracy. Our research indicates that the overfitting is a combination reaction of the multi-scale pattern coupling in time series and the fixed focusing scale of current models. First, we find that the patterns exhibited by a time series across various scales are reflective of its multi-periodic nature, where each scale corresponds to specific period length. Second, We find that the token size predominantly dictates model behavior, as it determines the scale at which the model focuses and the context size it can accommodate. Our idea is to decouple the multi-scale temporal patterns of time series and to model each pattern with its corresponding period length as token size. We introduced a novel series-decomposition module(MPSD), and a Multi-Token Pattern Recognition neural network(MTPR), enabling the model to handle \textit{inputs up to $10\times$ longer}. Sufficient context enhances performance(\textit{38% maximum precision improvement}), and the decoupling approach offers \textit{Low complexity($0.22\times$ cost)} and \textit{high interpretability}.</p></details> | <details><summary>rewri...</summary><p>rewrite and authorship changing</p></details> |
| **[Breaking the Context Bottleneck on Long Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16572v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time-series forecasting is essential for planning and decision-making in economics, energy, and transportation, where long foresight is required. To obtain such long foresight, models must be both efficient and effective in processing long sequence. Recent advancements have enhanced the efficiency of these models; however, the challenge of effectively leveraging longer sequences persists. This is primarily due to the tendency of these models to overfit when presented with extended inputs, necessitating the use of shorter input lengths to maintain tolerable error margins. In this work, we investigate the multiscale modeling method and propose the Logsparse Decomposable Multiscaling (LDM) framework for the efficient and effective processing of long sequences. We demonstrate that by decoupling patterns at different scales in time series, we can enhance predictability by reducing non-stationarity, improve efficiency through a compact long input representation, and simplify the architecture by providing clear task assignments. Experimental results demonstrate that LDM not only outperforms all baselines in long-term forecasting benchmarks, but also reducing both training time and memory costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>rewri...</summary><p>rewrite and authorship changing</p></details> |
| **[TimeCopilot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00616v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce TimeCopilot, the first open-source agentic framework for forecasting that combines multiple Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) through a single unified API. TimeCopilot automates the forecasting pipeline: feature analysis, model selection, cross-validation, and forecast generation, while providing natural language explanations and supporting direct queries about the future. The framework is LLM-agnostic, compatible with both commercial and open-source models, and supports ensembles across diverse forecasting families. Results on the large-scale GIFT-Eval benchmark show that TimeCopilot achieves state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting performance at low cost.

| **[Estimation of High-Dimensional Markov-Switching VAR Models with an Approximate EM Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07456v3)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regime shifts in high-dimensional time series arise naturally in many applications, from neuroimaging to finance. This problem has received considerable attention in low-dimensional settings, with both Bayesian and frequentist methods used extensively for parameter estimation. The EM algorithm is a particularly popular strategy for parameter estimation in low-dimensional settings, although the statistical properties of the resulting estimates have not been well understood. Furthermore, its extension to high-dimensional time series has proved challenging. To overcome these challenges, in this paper we propose an approximate EM algorithm for Markov-switching VAR models that leads to efficient computation and also facilitates the investigation of asymptotic properties of the resulting parameter estimates. We establish the consistency of the proposed EM algorithm in high dimensions and investigate its performance via simulation studies. We also demonstrate the algorithm by analyzing a brain electroencephalography (EEG) dataset recorded on a patient experiencing epileptic seizure.</p></details> |  |

Standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches for fitting ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to time-series data involve proposing trial parameter sets, numerically integrating the ODEs forward in time, and accepting or rejecting the trial parameter sets. When the model dynamics depend nonlinearly on the parameters, as is generally the case, trial parameter sets are often rejected, and MCMC approaches become prohibitively computationally costly to converge. Here, we build on methods for numerical continuation and trajectory optimization to introduce an approach in which we use Langevin dynamics in the joint space of variables and parameters to sample models that satisfy constraints on the dynamics. We demonstrate the method by sampling Hopf bifurcations and limit cycles of a model of a biochemical oscillator in a Bayesian framework for parameter estimation, and we attain performance that matches or exceeds the performance of leading MCMC approaches that require numerically integrating the ODEs forward in time. We describe numerical experiments that provide insight into the speedup. The method is general and can be used in any framework for parameter estimation and model selection.</p></details> | 32 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Seasonal and periodic patterns of ischemic heart disease in New York using the Variable Multiple Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03710v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Seasonal patterns of the incidence, hospital visits, and mortality of ischemic heart disease (IHD) have been widely reported. This study aims to investigate seasonal and periodic patterns of IHD hospitalizations in New York using a novel bootstrap approach, the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB) method. Using a bandpass filter, VBPBB isolates the periodically correlated (PC) component of interest from other PC components and noise before bootstrapping, preserving correlation structures and yielding more precise 95\% confidence intervals than existing periodic bootstrapping methods. We examine weekly, monthly, and annual patterns, along with their harmonic frequencies, in the IHD hospitalization. In addition to the pre-defined frequencies, we also examine the frequencies with the highest amplitudes in the periodogram. By aggregating bootstrap results from statistically significant PC components, a 95\% CI band that preserves multiple periodic correlation structures was obtained. Statistically significant variation was observed for the weekly, annual component, and its 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 6th harmonics. CI bands obtained from VBPBB were much narrower than those from existing periodic bootstrapping methods. VBPBB substantially improves the precision of periodic mean estimates while preserving periodic correlation structures, making it suitable for time series with multiple periodic patterns and high noise, such as in environmental or healthcare data.</p></details> |  |

| **[Semi-decentralized Federated Time Series Prediction with Client Availability Budgets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03660v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) effectively promotes collaborative training among distributed clients with privacy considerations in the Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. Despite of data heterogeneity, FL clients may also be constrained by limited energy and availability budgets. Therefore, effective selection of clients participating in training is of vital importance for the convergence of the global model and the balance of client contributions. In this paper, we discuss the performance impact of client availability with time-series data on federated learning. We set up three different scenarios that affect the availability of time-series data and propose FedDeCAB, a novel, semi-decentralized client selection method applying probabilistic rankings of available clients. When a client is disconnected from the server, FedDeCAB allows obtaining partial model parameters from the nearest neighbor clients for joint optimization, improving the performance of offline models and reducing communication overhead. Experiments based on real-world large-scale taxi and vessel trajectory datasets show that FedDeCAB is effective under highly heterogeneous data distribution, limited communication budget, and dynamic client offline or rejoining.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Evaluation of Factors Affecting SHAP Explanation of Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03649v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainable AI (XAI) has become an increasingly important topic for understanding and attributing the predictions made by complex Time Series Classification (TSC) models. Among attribution methods, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is widely regarded as an excellent attribution method; but its computational complexity, which scales exponentially with the number of features, limits its practicality for long time series. To address this, recent studies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a single attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically reduces SHAP running time. However, the choice of the optimal segmentation strategy remains an open question. In this work, we investigated eight different Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment compositions affect the explanation quality. We evaluate these approaches using two established XAI evaluation methodologies: InterpretTime and AUC Difference. Through experiments on both Multivariate (MTS) and Univariate Time Series (UTS), we find that the number of segments has a greater impact on explanation quality than the specific segmentation method. Notably, equal-length segmentation consistently outperforms most of the custom time series segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attribution normalisation technique that weights segments by their length and we show that it consistently improves attribution quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure-preserving contrastive learning for spatial time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06380v4)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of neural network models largely relies on learning meaningful latent patterns from data, where self-supervised learning of informative representations can enhance model performance and generalisability. However, self-supervised representation learning for spatially characterised time series, which are ubiquitous in transportation domain, poses unique challenges due to the necessity of maintaining fine-grained spatio-temporal similarities in the latent space. In this study, we introduce two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance the contrastive learning objective and the need for structure preservation, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively manages this trade-off and stabilises training. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, including multivariate time series classification to demonstrate its general applicability, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction to highlight its particular usefulness in encoding traffic interactions. Across all tasks, our method preserves the similarity structures more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. This method can be integrated with an arbitrary neural network model and is particularly beneficial for time series data with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, our findings suggest that well-preserved similarity structures in the latent space indicate more informative and useful representations. This provides insights to design more effective neural networks for data-driven transportation research. Our code is made openly accessible with all resulting data at https://github.com/yiru-jiao/spclt</p></details> | <details><summary>TL;DR...</summary><p>TL;DR: Preserving certain structures of similarity relations in spatio-temporal data can improve downstream task performance via contrastive learning</p></details> |
| **[Temporal social network modeling of mobile connectivity data with graph neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03319v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art data-driven tool for modeling connectivity data of graph-structured complex networks and integrating information of their nodes and edges in space and time. However, as of yet, the analysis of social networks using the time series of people's mobile connectivity data has not been extensively investigated. In the present study, we investigate four snapshot - based temporal GNNs in predicting the phone call and SMS activity between users of a mobile communication network. In addition, we develop a simple non - GNN baseline model using recently proposed EdgeBank method. Our analysis shows that the ROLAND temporal GNN outperforms the baseline model in most cases, whereas the other three GNNs perform on average worse than the baseline. The results show that GNN based approaches hold promise in the analysis of temporal social networks through mobile connectivity data. However, due to the relatively small performance margin between ROLAND and the baseline model, further research is required on specialized GNN architectures for temporal social network analysis.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Evaluation of Stress Detection as Time Series Events -- A Novel Window-Based F1-Metric](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03240v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate evaluation of event detection in time series is essential for applications such as stress monitoring with wearable devices, where ground truth is typically annotated as single-point events, even though the underlying phenomena are gradual and temporally diffused. Standard metrics like F1 and point-adjusted F1 (F1$_{pa}$) often misrepresent model performance in such real-world, imbalanced datasets. We introduce a window-based F1 metric (F1$_w$) that incorporates temporal tolerance, enabling a more robust assessment of event detection when exact alignment is unrealistic. Empirical analysis in three physiological datasets, two in-the-wild (ADARP, Wrist Angel) and one experimental (ROAD), indicates that F1$_w$ reveals meaningful model performance patterns invisible to conventional metrics, while its window size can be adapted to domain knowledge to avoid overestimation. We show that the choice of evaluation metric strongly influences the interpretation of model performance: using predictions from TimesFM, only our temporally tolerant metrics reveal statistically significant improvements over random and null baselines in the two in-the-wild use cases. This work addresses key gaps in time series evaluation and provides practical guidance for healthcare applications where requirements for temporal precision vary by context.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Optimizing Federated Learning for Scalable Power-demand Forecasting in Microgrids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08022v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time monitoring of power consumption in cities and micro-grids through the Internet of Things (IoT) can help forecast future demand and optimize grid operations. But moving all consumer-level usage data to the cloud for predictions and analysis at fine time scales can expose activity patterns. Federated Learning~(FL) is a privacy-sensitive collaborative DNN training approach that retains data on edge devices, trains the models on private data locally, and aggregates the local models in the cloud. But key challenges exist: (i) clients can have non-independently identically distributed~(non-IID) data, and (ii) the learning should be computationally cheap while scaling to 1000s of (unseen) clients. In this paper, we develop and evaluate several optimizations to FL training across edge and cloud for time-series demand forecasting in micro-grids and city-scale utilities using DNNs to achieve a high prediction accuracy while minimizing the training cost. We showcase the benefit of using exponentially weighted loss while training and show that it further improves the prediction of the final model. Finally, we evaluate these strategies by validating over 1000s of clients for three states in the US from the OpenEIA corpus, and performing FL both in a pseudo-distributed setting and a Pi edge cluster. The results highlight the benefits of the proposed methods over baselines like ARIMA and DNNs trained for individual consumers, which are not scalable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information transmission: Inferring change area from change moment in time series remote sensing images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03112v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem dynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously indicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent performance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and change moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be inferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network, named CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure consistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers change area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time series analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction, and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference Extraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking is designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary enhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the Coarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the first step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two distinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class Activation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the change-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change moment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the change moment must have undergone a change.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches for IMTS either consider a two-stage impute-then-model framework or involve specialized architectures specific to a particular model and task. We perform a series of experiments to derive novel insights about the performance of IMTS methods on a variety of semi-synthetic and real-world datasets for both classification and forecasting. We also introduce Missing Feature-aware Time Series Modeling (MissTSM) or MissTSM, a novel model-agnostic and imputation-free approach for IMTS modeling. We show that MissTSM shows competitive performance compared to other IMTS approaches, especially when the amount of missing values is large and the data lacks simplistic periodic structures - conditions common to real-world IMTS applications.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[AR-KAN: Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02967v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional neural networks frequently face challenges in spectral analysis of signals. To address this challenge, Fourier neural networks (FNNs) and similar approaches integrate components of Fourier series into the structure of neural networks. Nonetheless, a significant hurdle is often overlooked: the superposition of periodic signals does not necessarily result in a periodic signal. For example, when forecasting almost periodic functions composed of signals with incommensurate frequencies, traditional models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) frequently outperform most neural networks including large language models (LLMs). To tackle this goal, we propose Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced AR-KAN, a hybrid model that combines the benefits of both methods. Using the Universal Myopic Mapping Theorem, we apply a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the static nonlinear part and include memory through a pre-trained AR component, which can be explained to retain the most useful information while eliminating redundancy. Experimental data indicates that AR-KAN delivers superior results on $72\%$ of real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

Usually, DRPs act as leaders and determine electricity pricing strategies to maximize their economic revenue, while end-users adjust their power consumption following the pricing signals. However, this profit-seeking bi-level optimization model often neglects the satisfaction of end-users participating in DR programs. In addition, the detailed mathematical models underlying user decision-making strategy and satisfaction evaluation mechanism are typically unavailable to DRPs, posing significant challenges to conventional model-based solution methods. To address these issues, this paper designs a user-side satisfaction evaluation mechanism and proposes a multi-branch temporal fusion twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MBTF-TD3) reinforcement learning algorithm. User satisfaction feedback is incorporated into the reward function via a dynamically adjusted penalty term. The proposed MBTF structure effectively extracts temporal feature dependencies in the time-series observation data, and the dynamically adjusted penalty function successfully enhances the overall satisfaction level of users. Several experiments are conducted to validate the performance and the effectiveness of our proposed solution algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version corrects equation display errors that occurred in the IEEE Xplore version.

| **[Recursive Gaussian Process State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14679v3)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning dynamical models from data is not only fundamental but also holds great promise for advancing principle discovery, time-series prediction, and controller design. Among various approaches, Gaussian Process State-Space Models (GPSSMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their combination of flexibility and interpretability. However, for online learning, the field lacks an efficient method suitable for scenarios where prior information regarding data distribution and model function is limited. To address this issue, this paper proposes a recursive GPSSM method with adaptive capabilities for both operating domains and Gaussian process (GP) hyperparameters. Specifically, we first utilize first-order linearization to derive a Bayesian update equation for the joint distribution between the system state and the GP model, enabling closed-form and domain-independent learning. Second, an online selection algorithm for inducing points is developed based on informative criteria to achieve lightweight learning. Third, to support online hyperparameter optimization, we recover historical measurement information from the current filtering distribution. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability of our method compared to state-of-the-art online GPSSM techniques.</p></details> |  |

This study employs machine learning to analyze genomic and epidemiological data from the public databases for molecular typing and microbial genome diversity (PubMLST), incorporating data from UK government-supported AMR surveillance by the Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland. We identify AMR patterns in Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolates collected in the UK from 2001 to 2017. The research integrates whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, epidemiological metadata, and economic projections to identify key resistance determinants and forecast future resistance trends and healthcare costs. We investigate gyrA mutations for fluoroquinolone resistance and the tet(O) gene for tetracycline resistance, training a Random Forest model validated with bootstrap resampling (1,000 samples, 95% confidence intervals), achieving 74% accuracy in predicting AMR phenotypes. Time-series forecasting models (SARIMA, SIR, and Prophet) predict a rise in campylobacteriosis cases, potentially exceeding 130 cases per 100,000 people by 2050, with an economic burden projected to surpass 1.9 billion GBP annually if left unchecked. An enhanced Random Forest system, analyzing 6,683 isolates, refines predictions by incorporating temporal patterns, uncertainty estimation, and resistance trend modeling, indicating sustained high beta-lactam resistance, increasing fluoroquinolone resistance, and fluctuating tetracycline resistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 1 table.

However, current methods struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6 synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Temporal Knowledge-Base Creation for Fine-Grained Opinion Analysis with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02363v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a scalable method for constructing a temporal opinion knowledge base with large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators. Despite the demonstrated utility of time-series opinion analysis of text for downstream applications such as forecasting and trend analysis, existing methodologies underexploit this potential due to the absence of temporally grounded fine-grained annotations. Our approach addresses this gap by integrating well-established opinion mining formulations into a declarative LLM annotation pipeline, enabling structured opinion extraction without manual prompt engineering. We define three data models grounded in sentiment and opinion mining literature, serving as schemas for structured representation. We perform rigorous quantitative evaluation of our pipeline using human-annotated test samples. We carry out the final annotations using two separate LLMs, and inter-annotator agreement is computed label-wise across the fine-grained opinion dimensions, analogous to human annotation protocols. The resulting knowledge base encapsulates time-aligned, structured opinions and is compatible with applications in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), temporal question answering, and timeline summarisation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods offer suboptimal distribution modeling and suffer from a mismatch between training and evaluation metrics. Surprisingly, we found that augmenting a strong point estimator with a zero-mean Gaussian, whose standard deviation matches its training error, can yield state-of-the-art performance in PTSF. In this work, we propose RDIT, a plug-and-play framework that combines point estimation and residual-based conditional diffusion with a bidirectional Mamba network. We theoretically prove that the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) can be minimized by adjusting to an optimal standard deviation and then derive algorithms to achieve distribution matching. Evaluations on eight multivariate datasets across varied forecasting horizons demonstrate that RDIT achieves lower CRPS, rapid inference, and improved coverage compared to strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Diffusion Models for Generative Forecasting of Financial Charts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02308v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative models have enabled significant progress in tasks such as generating and editing images from text, as well as creating videos from text prompts, and these methods are being applied across various fields. However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on time-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on diverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a single image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends. Unlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns using architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using diffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the generated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of leveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our findings motivate further research to address the current limitations and expand their applicability.</p></details> |  |

Traditional machine learning approaches, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, often rely on manual feature engineering and struggle with irregular, incomplete time-series data commonly present in electronic health records. We introduce an end-to-end deep learning framework integrating an unsupervised autoencoder for automatic feature extraction with a multilayer perceptron classifier for binary sepsis risk prediction. To enhance clinical applicability, we implement a customized down sampling strategy that extracts high information density segments during training and a non-overlapping dynamic sliding window mechanism for real-time inference. Preprocessed time series data are represented as fixed dimension vectors with explicit missingness indicators, mitigating bias and noise. We validate our approach on three ICU cohorts. Our end-to-end model achieves accuracies of 74.6 percent, 80.6 percent, and 93.5 percent, respectively, consistently outperforming traditional machine learning baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's superior robustness, generalizability, and clinical utility for early sepsis detection across heterogeneous ICU environments.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods may fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales (ST-scales, i.e., scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes). In this work, we propose ST-Hyper to model the high-order dependencies across multiple ST-scales through adaptive hypergraph modeling. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) module to extract features at multiple ST-scales. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hypergraph Modeling (AHM) module that learns a sparse hypergraph to capture robust high-order dependencies among features. In addition, we interact with these features through tri-phase hypergraph propagation, which can comprehensively capture multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics. Experimental results on six real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that ST-Hyper achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baselines with an average MAE reduction of 3.8\% and 6.8\% for long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

Candidate PMU locations are ranked via a cross-validated Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, and each selection is refined through local neighborhood exploration to produce a near-optimal sensor set. The resulting PMU subset is then supplied to a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for faulted-line localization and fault-type classification from time-series measurements. Evaluation on modified IEEE 34- and IEEE 123-bus systems demonstrates that the proposed FSNR-SVM method identifies a minimal PMU configuration that achieves the best overall CNN performance, attaining over 96 percent accuracy in fault location and over 99 percent accuracy in fault-type classification on the IEEE 34 system, and approximately 94 percent accuracy in fault location and around 99.8 percent accuracy in fault-type classification on the IEEE 123 system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper submitted to 57th North American Power Symposium (NAPS) 2025</p></details> |

Future order distribution information, which reflects the distribution of orders in on-demand food delivery, is crucial for the performance of logistical demand-supply forecasting. Current studies utilize spatial-temporal analysis methods to model future order distribution information from serious time slices. However, learning future order distribution in online delivery platform is a time-series-insensitive problem with strong randomness. These approaches often struggle to effectively capture this information while remaining efficient. This paper proposes an innovative spatiotemporal learning model that utilizes only two graphs (ongoing and global) to learn future order distribution information, achieving superior performance compared to traditional spatial-temporal long-series methods. The main contributions are as follows: (1) The introduction of ongoing and global graphs in logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting compared to traditional long time series significantly enhances forecasting performance. (2) An innovative graph learning network framework using adaptive future graph learning and innovative cross attention mechanism (ACA-Net) is proposed to extract future order distribution information, effectively learning a robust future graph that substantially improves logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting outcomes. (3) The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in real-world production environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, DASFAA2025 conference full paper</p></details> |

Eye Tracking-Based Modeling of Situational Awareness in Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05025v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g., bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved 83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.</p></details> |  |
| **[When LLM Meets Time Series: Can LLMs Perform Multi-Step Time Series Reasoning and Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01822v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked growing interest in their application to time series analysis tasks. However, their ability to perform complex reasoning over temporal data in real-world application domains remains underexplored. To move toward this goal, a first step is to establish a rigorous benchmark dataset for evaluation. In this work, we introduce the TSAIA Benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate LLMs as time-series AI assistants. To ensure both scientific rigor and practical relevance, we surveyed over 20 academic publications and identified 33 real-world task formulations. The benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of challenges, ranging from constraint-aware forecasting to anomaly detection with threshold calibration: tasks that require compositional reasoning and multi-step time series analysis. The question generator is designed to be dynamic and extensible, supporting continuous expansion as new datasets or task types are introduced. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tasks, we adopt task-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics to ensure meaningful evaluation for each task. We apply this benchmark to assess eight state-of-the-art LLMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our analysis reveals limitations in current models' ability to assemble complex time series analysis workflows, underscoring the need for specialized methodologies for domain-specific adaptation. Our benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Melady/TSAIA, and the code is available at https://github.com/USC-Melady/TSAIA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monitoring Time Series for Relevant Changes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01756v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of sequentially testing for changes in the mean parameter of a time series, compared to a benchmark period. Most tests in the literature focus on the null hypothesis of a constant mean versus the alternative of a single change at an unknown time. Yet in many applications it is unrealistic that no change occurs at all, or that after one change the time series remains stationary forever. We introduce a new setup, modeling the sequence of means as a piecewise constant function with arbitrarily many changes. Instead of testing for a change, we ask whether the evolving sequence of means, say $(\mu_n)_{n \geq 1}$, stays within a narrow corridor around its initial value, that is, $\mu_n \in [\mu_1-\Delta, \mu_1+\Delta]$ for all $n \ge 1$. Combining elements from multiple change point detection with a H\"older-type monitoring procedure, we develop a new online monitoring tool. A key challenge in both construction and proof of validity is that the risk of committing a type-I error after any time $n$ fundamentally depends on the unknown future of the time series. Simulations support our theoretical results and we present two real-world applications: (1) healthcare monitoring, with a focus on blood glucose tracking, and (2) political consensus analysis via citizen opinion polls.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting for Smart and Connected Infrastructures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14875v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of deep learning models has revolutionized various industries over the last decade, leading to a surge in connected devices and infrastructures. However, these models can be tricked into making incorrect predictions with high confidence, leading to disastrous failures and security concerns. To this end, we explore the impact of adversarial attacks on multivariate time-series forecasting and investigate methods to counter them. Specifically, we employ untargeted white-box attacks, namely the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and the Basic Iterative Method (BIM), to poison the inputs to the training process, effectively misleading the model. We also illustrate the subtle modifications to the inputs after the attack, which makes detecting the attack using the naked eye quite difficult. Having demonstrated the feasibility of these attacks, we develop robust models through adversarial training and model hardening. We are among the first to showcase the transferability of these attacks and defenses by extrapolating our work from the benchmark electricity data to a larger, 10-year real-world data used for predicting the time-to-failure of hard disks. Our experimental results confirm that the attacks and defenses achieve the desired security thresholds, leading to a 72.41% and 94.81% decrease in RMSE for the electricity and hard disk datasets respectively after implementing the adversarial defenses.</p></details> | 18 pages, 34 figures |
| **[Multilevel functional distributional models with application to continuous glucose monitoring in diabetes clinical trials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10514v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a minimally invasive technology that measures blood glucose every few minutes for weeks or months at a time. CGM data are often collected in the free-living environment and is strongly related to sleep, physical activity and meal intake. As the timing of these activities varies substantially within- and between-individuals, it is difficult to model CGM trajectories as a function of time of day. Therefore, in practice, CGM trajectories are often reduced to one or two scalar summaries of the thousands of measurements collected for a study participant. To alleviate the potential loss of information, the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the CGM time series was proposed as an alternative. Here we address the problem of conducting inference on cdfs in clinical trials with long follow up and frequent measurements. Our approach provides three major innovations: (1) modeling the entire cdf and preserving its monotonicity; (2) accounting for the cdfs correlation (because they are measured on the same individual), continuity (results are robust to the choice of the probability grid), and differential error (e.g., medians have lower variability than $0.99$ quantiles); and (3) preserving the family-wise error when the observed data are longitudinal samples of cdfs. We focus on modeling data collected by The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Continuous Glucose Monitoring Group in a large clinical trial that collected CGM data every few minutes for 26 weeks. Our basic observation unit is the distribution of CGM observations in a four-week interval. The scientific goals are to: (1) identify and quantify the effects of factors that affect glycaemic control in type 1 diabetes patients (T1D); and (2) identify and characterize the patients who respond to treatment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-driven Discovery of Digital Twins in Biomedical Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21484v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent technological advances have expanded the availability of high-throughput biological datasets, enabling the reliable design of digital twins of biomedical systems or patients. Such computational tools represent key reaction networks driving perturbation or drug response and can guide drug discovery and personalized therapeutics. Yet, their development still relies on laborious data integration by the human modeler, so that automated approaches are critically needed. The success of data-driven system discovery in Physics, rooted in clean datasets and well-defined governing laws, has fueled interest in applying similar techniques in Biology, which presents unique challenges. Here, we reviewed methodologies for automatically inferring digital twins from biological time series, which mostly involve symbolic or sparse regression. We evaluate algorithms according to eight biological and methodological challenges, associated to noisy/incomplete data, multiple conditions, prior knowledge integration, latent variables, high dimensionality, unobserved variable derivatives, candidate library design, and uncertainty quantification. Upon these criteria, sparse regression generally outperformed symbolic regression, particularly when using Bayesian frameworks. We further highlight the emerging role of deep learning and large language models, which enable innovative prior knowledge integration, though the reliability and consistency of such approaches must be improved. While no single method addresses all challenges, we argue that progress in learning digital twins will come from hybrid and modular frameworks combining chemical reaction network-based mechanistic grounding, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and the generative and knowledge integration capacities of deep learning. To support their development, we further propose a benchmarking framework to evaluate methods across all challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Time-Series Model for Areal Data Using Spatially Correlated Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01604v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional spatio-temporal models for areal data typically begin with spatial structure imposed at the level of random effects and later extend to include temporal dynamics. We propose an alternative hierarchical modeling framework that captures temporal trends in areal data through Gaussian processes that share spatial information via correlated variance components. This allows the model to better capture shared patterns of variability across regions while preserving local temporal dynamics, offering a more flexible representation of spatio-temporal processes. Specifically, we extend independent Gaussian-process models for time-series data to a spatially correlated framework by placing a conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior on the parameters governing the temporal variability and imposing a conditional dependence of the temporal range on the temporal variance. We apply this model to two case studies: monthly malaria incidence in Niassa, Mozambique, and weekly food insecurity prevalence in Cameroon. Inference is conducted within a Bayesian framework using approximate posterior sampling. Given the hierarchical structure of the model, we employ a combination of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, including the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA), Metropolis-Hastings, and Gibbs sampling. In both applications, the model demonstrates strong in-sample performance with narrow credible intervals and outperforms established spatio-temporal approaches in many regions when forecasting. These results underscore the model's ability to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies while maintaining interpretability, key in settings with sparse data and policy relevance. By accounting for spatio-temporal variation through the evolution of temporal dynamics themselves, our approach offers a flexible and principled tool for many applied contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material included</p></details> |
| **[Discrete Fourier Transform versus Discrete Chi-Square Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01540v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We compare two time series analysis methods, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and our Discrete Chi-square Method (DCM). DCM is designed for detecting many signals superimposed on an unknown trend. The solution for the non-linear DCM model is an ill-posed problem. The backbone of DCM is the Gauss-Markov theorem that the least squares fit is the best unbiased estimator for linear regression models. DCM is a simple numerical time series analysis method that performs a massive number of linear least squares fits. We show that our numerical solution for the DCM model fulfills the three conditions of a well-posed problem: existence, uniqueness and stability. The Fisher-test is used to identify the best DCM model from all alternative tested DCM models. The correct DCM model must also pass our Predictivity-test. Our analyses of seven different simulated data samples expose the weaknesses of DFT and the efficiency of DCM. The DCM signal and trend detection depend only on the sample size and the accuracy of data. DCM is an ideal forecasting method because the time span of observations is irrelevant. We recommend fast sampling of large high quality datasets and the analysis of those datasets using numerical DCM parallel computation Python code.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |

When deploying at the edge, we found the underutilization of frequency domain analysis in robotic manipulation trajectory prediction leads to neglecting the inherent rhythm information embedded within action sequences, resulting in errors at critical moments. To address this, we reframe imitation learning policies through the lens of time-scale domain and introduce the Wavelet Policy. This novel approach employs wavelet transforms (WT) and new Features Extractor (FE) for feature preprocessing and extracts multi-scale features using the Single Encoder to Multiple Decoder (SE2MD) architecture. Furthermore, to enhance feature mapping in the scale domain and appropriately increase model capacity, we introduce a Learnable Scale Domain Filter (LSDF) after each decoder, improving adaptability under different visual conditions. Our results show that the Wavelet Policy maintaining a comparable parameter count outperforms SOTA end-to-end methods on four challenging simulation robotic arm tasks and real tasks, especially at critical moments and remote settings simultaneously. We release the source code and model checkpoint of simulation task at https://github.com/lurenjia384/Wavelet_Policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[ARCANE -- Early Detection of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09365v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are major drivers of space weather disturbances, posing risks to both technological infrastructure and human activities. Automatic detection of ICMEs in solar wind in situ data is essential for early warning systems. While several methods have been proposed to identify these structures in time series data, robust real-time detection remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present ARCANE - the first framework explicitly designed for early ICME detection in streaming solar wind data under realistic operational constraints, enabling event identification without requiring observation of the full structure. Our approach evaluates the strengths and limitations of detection models by comparing a machine learning-based method to a threshold-based baseline. The ResUNet++ model, previously validated on science data, significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly in detecting high-impact events, while retaining solid performance on lower-impact cases. Notably, we find that using real-time solar wind (RTSW) data instead of high-resolution science data leads to only minimal performance degradation. Despite the challenges of operational settings, our detection pipeline achieves an F1-Score of 0.37, with an average detection delay of 24.5% of the event's duration while processing only a minimal portion of the event data. As more data becomes available, the performance increases significantly. These results mark a substantial step forward in automated space weather monitoring and lay the groundwork for enhanced real-time forecasting capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 figures, 1 table, submitted to AGU Space Weather on 14th May 2025, revised 29th August 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bootstrap Diagnostic Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01351v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Violation of the assumptions underlying classical (Gaussian) limit theory frequently leads to unreliable statistical inference. This paper shows the novel result that the bootstrap can detect such violation by means of simple and powerful tests which (a) induce no pre-testing bias, (b) can be performed using the same critical values in a broad range of applications, and (c) are consistent against deviations from asymptotic normality. By focusing on the discrepancy between the conditional distribution of a bootstrap statistic and the (limiting) Gaussian distribution which obtains under valid specification, we show how to assess whether this discrepancy is large enough to indicate specification invalidity. The method, which is computationally straightforward, only requires to measure the discrepancy between the bootstrap and the Gaussian distributions based on a sample of i.i.d. draws of the bootstrap statistic. We derive sufficient conditions for the randomness in the data to mix with the randomness in the bootstrap repetitions in a way such that (a), (b) and (c) above hold. To demonstrate the practical relevance and broad applicability of our diagnostic procedure, we discuss five scenarios where the asymptotic Gaussian approximation may fail: (i) weak instruments in instrumental variable regression; (ii) non-stationarity in autoregressive time series; (iii) parameters near or at the boundary of the parameter space; (iv) infinite variance innovations in a location model for i.i.d. data; (v) invalidity of the delta method due to (near-)rank deficiency in the implied Jacobian matrix. An illustration drawn from the empirical macroeconomic literature concludes.</p></details> |  |
| **[StoxLSTM: A Stochastic Extended Long Short-Term Memory Network for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01187v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network has attracted widespread research interest due to its enhanced capability to model complex temporal dependencies in diverse time series applications. Despite its success, there is still potential to further improve its representational capacity and forecasting performance, particularly on challenging real-world datasets with unknown, intricate, and hierarchical dynamics. In this work, we propose a stochastic xLSTM, termed StoxLSTM, that improves the original architecture into a state space modeling framework by incorporating stochastic latent variables within xLSTM. StoxLSTM models the latent dynamic evolution through specially designed recurrent blocks, enabling it to effectively capture the underlying temporal patterns and dependencies. Extensive experiments on publicly available benchmark datasets from multiple research communities demonstrate that StoxLSTM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with better robustness and stronger generalization ability.</p></details> |  |

Extending the Dynamic Probability Density Decomposition (DPDD), we embed distributional dynamics into Wasserstein geometry via a Koopman operator framework. Our approach introduces an importance-weighted variant of Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD), enabling accurate, closed-form forecasts in 2-Wasserstein space. Theoretical guarantees are established: our estimator achieves spectral convergence and optimal finite-sample Wasserstein error. Simulation studies and a real-world application to U.S. housing price distributions show substantial improvements over existing methods such as Wasserstein Autoregression. By integrating optimal transport, functional time series modeling, and spectral operator theory, DPDD offers a scalable and interpretable solution for distributional forecasting. This work has broad implications for behavioral science, public health, finance, and neuroimaging--domains where evolving distributions arise naturally. Our framework contributes to functional data analysis on non-Euclidean spaces and provides a general tool for modeling and forecasting distributional time series.</p></details> | revised |
| **[CCE: Confidence-Consistency Evaluation for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01098v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Anomaly Detection metrics serve as crucial tools for model evaluation. However, existing metrics suffer from several limitations: insufficient discriminative power, strong hyperparameter dependency, sensitivity to perturbations, and high computational overhead. This paper introduces Confidence-Consistency Evaluation (CCE), a novel evaluation metric that simultaneously measures prediction confidence and uncertainty consistency. By employing Bayesian estimation to quantify the uncertainty of anomaly scores, we construct both global and event-level confidence and consistency scores for model predictions, resulting in a concise CCE metric. Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate that CCE possesses strict boundedness, Lipschitz robustness against score perturbations, and linear time complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Furthermore, we establish RankEval, a benchmark for comparing the ranking capabilities of various metrics. RankEval represents the first standardized and reproducible evaluation pipeline that enables objective comparison of evaluation metrics. Both CCE and RankEval implementations are fully open-source.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we define optimal e-values for testing between maximum entropy models, both in the microcanonical (hard constraints) and canonical (soft constraints) settings. We show that, when testing between two hypotheses that are both microcanonical, the so-called growth-rate optimal e-variable admits an exact analytical expression, which also serves as a valid e-variable in the canonical case. For canonical tests, where exact solutions are typically unavailable, we introduce a microcanonical approximation and verify its excellent performance via both theoretical arguments and numerical simulations. We then consider constrained binary models, focusing on $2 \times k$ contingency tables -- an essential framework in statistics and a natural representation for various models of complex systems. Our microcanonical optimal e-variable performs well in both settings, constituting a new tool that remains effective even in the challenging case when the number $k$ of groups grows with the sample size, as in models with growing features used for the analysis of real-world heterogeneous networks and time-series.</p></details> |  |

The policy, publicly justified as a measure to curb misinformation and counter foreign influence, was abruptly rolled out on April 28, 2022. Using an interrupted time series design, we find no decline in participation by overseas users. Instead, it significantly reduced domestic engagement with local issues outside users' home provinces, particularly among critical comments. Evidence indicates this decline was not driven by generalized fear or concerns about credibility, but by a surge in regionally discriminatory replies that raised the social cost of cross-provincial engagement. Our findings suggest that identity disclosure tools can have unintended consequences by activating existing social divisions in ways that reinforce state control without direct censorship.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 8 pages, Supplement: 38 pages</p></details> |

Among these, two prominent classes are regularization-based defenses, which shape traffic using fixed padding rules, and supersequence-based approaches, which conceal traces among predefined patterns. In this work, we present a unified framework for designing an adaptive WF defense that combines the effectiveness of regularization with the provable security of supersequence-style grouping. The scheme first extracts behavioural patterns from traces and clusters them into (k,l)-diverse anonymity sets; an early-time-series classifier (adapted from ECDIRE) then switches from a conservative global set of regularization parameters to the lighter, set-specific parameters. We instantiate the design as Adaptive Tamaraw, a variant of Tamaraw that assigns padding parameters on a per-cluster basis while retaining its original information-theoretic guarantee. Comprehensive experiments on public real-world datasets confirm the benefits. By tuning k, operators can trade privacy for efficiency: in its high-privacy mode Adaptive Tamaraw pushes the bound on any attacker's accuracy below 30%, whereas in efficiency-centred settings it cuts total overhead by 99% compared with classic Tamaraw.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148v4)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</p></details> | 34 pages |

Recently, their application has expanded to time series forecasting (TSF), yielding promising results. Existing surveys on time series primarily focus on the application of diffusion models to time series tasks or merely provide model-by-model introductions of diffusion-based TSF models, without establishing a systematic taxonomy for existing diffusion-based TSF models. In this survey, we firstly introduce several standard diffusion models and their prevalent variants, explaining their adaptation to TSF tasks. Then, we provide a comprehensive review of diffusion models for TSF, paying special attention to the sources of conditional information and the mechanisms for integrating this conditioning within the models. In analyzing existing approaches using diffusion models for TSF, we provide a systematic categorization and a comprehensive summary of them in this survey. Furthermore, we examine several foundational diffusion models applied to TSF, alongside commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss the progress and limitations of these approaches, as well as potential future research directions for diffusion-based TSF. Overall, this survey offers a comprehensive overview of recent progress and future prospects for diffusion models in TSF, serving as a valuable reference for researchers in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resting-state fMRI Analysis using Quantum Time-series Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00711v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a pivotal tool for revealing intrinsic brain network connectivity and identifying neural biomarkers of neuropsychiatric conditions. However, classical self-attention transformer models--despite their formidable representational power--struggle with quadratic complexity, large parameter counts, and substantial data requirements. To address these barriers, we introduce a Quantum Time-series Transformer, a novel quantum-enhanced transformer architecture leveraging Linear Combination of Unitaries and Quantum Singular Value Transformation. Unlike classical transformers, Quantum Time-series Transformer operates with polylogarithmic computational complexity, markedly reducing training overhead and enabling robust performance even with fewer parameters and limited sample sizes. Empirical evaluation on the largest-scale fMRI datasets from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study and the UK Biobank demonstrates that Quantum Time-series Transformer achieves comparable or superior predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art classical transformer models, with especially pronounced gains in small-sample scenarios. Interpretability analyses using SHapley Additive exPlanations further reveal that Quantum Time-series Transformer reliably identifies clinically meaningful neural biomarkers of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These findings underscore the promise of quantum-enhanced transformers in advancing computational neuroscience by more efficiently modeling complex spatio-temporal dynamics and improving clinical interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text Reinforcement for Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00687v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in time series forecasting (TSF) use multimodal inputs, such as text and historical time series data, to predict future values. These studies mainly focus on developing advanced techniques to integrate textual information with time series data to perform the task and achieve promising results. Meanwhile, these approaches rely on high-quality text and time series inputs, whereas in some cases, the text does not accurately or fully capture the information carried by the historical time series, which leads to unstable performance in multimodal TSF. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the textual content to improve the performance of multimodal TSF. In this paper, we propose improving multimodal TSF by reinforcing the text modalities. We propose a text reinforcement model (TeR) to generate reinforced text that addresses potential weaknesses in the original text, then apply this reinforced text to support the multimodal TSF model's understanding of the time series, improving TSF performance. To guide the TeR toward producing higher-quality reinforced text, we design a reinforcement learning approach that assigns rewards based on the impact of each reinforced text on the performance of the multimodal TSF model and its relevance to the TSF task. We optimize the TeR accordingly, so as to improve the quality of the generated reinforced text and enhance TSF performance. Extensive experiments on a real-world benchmark dataset covering various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which outperforms strong baselines and existing studies on the dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[A microsimulation model of behaviour change calibrated to reversal learning data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14062v2)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Behaviour change lies at the heart of many observable collective phenomena such as the transmission and control of infectious diseases, adoption of public health policies, and migration of animals to new habitats. Representing the process of individual behaviour change in computer simulations of these phenomena remains an open challenge. Often, computational models use phenomenological implementations with limited support from behavioural data. Without a strong connection to observable quantities, such models have limited utility for simulating observed and counterfactual scenarios of emergent phenomena because they cannot be validated or calibrated. Here, we present a simple stochastic microsimulation model of reversal learning that captures fundamental properties of individual behaviour change, namely, the capacity to learn based on accumulated reward signals, and the transient persistence of learned behaviour after rewards are removed or altered. The model has only two parameters, and we use approximate Bayesian computation to demonstrate that they are fully identifiable from empirical reversal learning time series data. Finally, we demonstrate how the model can be extended to account for the increased complexity of behavioural dynamics over longer time scales involving fluctuating stimuli. This work is a step towards the development and evaluation of fully identifiable individual-level behaviour change models that can function as validated submodels for complex simulations of collective behaviour change.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |
| **[BALM-TSF: Balanced Multimodal Alignment for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00622v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is a long-standing and highly challenging research topic. Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research has increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing textual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast discrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal architectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other, resulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address this modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw time series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive statistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt, producing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context alignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling strategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual embeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together integrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability to harness complementary information from text and time series. Code is available at https://github.com/ShiqiaoZhou/BALM-TSF.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOPED: A moving sum method for change point detection in pairwise extremal dependence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00585v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is increasingly the case with modern time series that many data sets of practical interest contain abrupt changes in structure. These changes may occur in complex characteristics such as the extremal dependence structure, and identifying such structural breaks remains a challenging problem. Many existing change point detection algorithms focus on changes in dependence across the entire distribution, rather than the tails, and approaches that are tailored to extremes typically make strict parametric assumptions or they are only applicable to bivariate data. We propose a nonparametric MOving sum-based approach for detecting multiple changes in the Pairwise Extremal Dependence (MOPED) of multivariate regularly varying data. To avoid the classical problem of threshold selection in the study of multivariate extremes, we further propose a multiscale, multi-threshold variant of MOPED that pools change point estimates across choices of the threshold and the bandwidth used in local estimation. Good performance of MOPED is illustrated in a simulation study, and we showcase its ability to identify subtle changes in tail dependence class in the absence of correlation changes. We further demonstrate the usefulness of MOPED by identifying changes in the extremal connectivity of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of seizure-prone neonates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Biological Pathway Informed Models with Graph Attention Networks (GATs)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00524v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biological pathways map gene-gene interactions that govern all human processes. Despite their importance, most ML models treat genes as unstructured tokens, discarding known pathway structure. The latest pathway-informed models capture pathway-pathway interactions, but still treat each pathway as a "bag of genes" via MLPs, discarding its topology and gene-gene interactions. We propose a Graph Attention Network (GAT) framework that models pathways at the gene level. We show that GATs generalize much better than MLPs, achieving an 81% reduction in MSE when predicting pathway dynamics under unseen treatment conditions. We further validate the correctness of our biological prior by encoding drug mechanisms via edge interventions, boosting model robustness. Finally, we show that our GAT model is able to correctly rediscover all five gene-gene interactions in the canonical TP53-MDM2-MDM4 feedback loop from raw time-series mRNA data, demonstrating potential to generate novel biological hypotheses directly from experimental data.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

We present a data-driven method leveraging recent advances in score-based generative modeling to construct reduced-order models for such cyclo-stationary time series. Our approach accurately reproduces the statistical properties and temporal correlations of the original data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic trajectories. We demonstrate the performance of the method through application to the Planet Simulator (PlaSim) climate model, constructing a reduced-order model for the 20 leading principal components of surface temperature driven by the annual cycle. The resulting surrogate model accurately reproduces the marginal and joint probability distributions, autocorrelation functions, and spatial coherence of the original climate system across multiple validation metrics. The approach offers substantial computational advantages, enabling generation of centuries of synthetic climate data in minutes compared to weeks required for equivalent full model simulations. This work opens new possibilities for efficient modeling of periodically forced systems across diverse scientific domains, providing a principled framework for balancing computational efficiency with physical fidelity in reduced-order modeling applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Vision Models for Time Series Analysis: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08869v2)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis has witnessed the inspiring development from traditional autoregressive models, deep learning models, to recent Transformers and Large Language Models (LLMs). Efforts in leveraging vision models for time series analysis have also been made along the way but are less visible to the community due to the predominant research on sequence modeling in this domain. However, the discrepancy between continuous time series and the discrete token space of LLMs, and the challenges in explicitly modeling the correlations of variates in multivariate time series have shifted some research attentions to the equally successful Large Vision Models (LVMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). To fill the blank in the existing literature, this survey discusses the advantages of vision models over LLMs in time series analysis. It provides a comprehensive and in-depth overview of the existing methods, with dual views of detailed taxonomy that answer the key research questions including how to encode time series as images and how to model the imaged time series for various tasks. Additionally, we address the challenges in the pre- and post-processing steps involved in this framework and outline future directions to further advance time series analysis with vision models.</p></details> |  |

We propose using data sampled from the real model $\mathbb P$ (which is unknown) with limited size to train a generative model $\mathbb Q$ (from which we can easily and adequately sample). With adaptive training and sampling methods that are tailor-made for time series data, we obtain quantification bounds between $\mathbb P$ and $\mathbb Q$ in terms of the adapted Wasserstein metric $\mathcal A W_2$. Importantly, the proposed adapted sampling method also facilitates {\it conditional sampling}. In the second part of this paper, we provide the stability of the mean-variance portfolio optimization problems in $\mathcal A W _2$. Then, combined with the error bounds and the stability result, we propose a policy gradient algorithm based on the generative environment, in which our innovative adapted sampling method provides approximate scenario generators. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm on both simulated and real data. For real data, the algorithm based on the generative environment produces portfolios that beat several important baselines, including the Markowitz portfolio, the equal weight (naive) portfolio, and S\&P 500.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available on https://github.com/fy-yuan/diffusion_dynamic_mv. v2 addresses certain typos and small issues</p></details> |

Transformer-based architectures such as Autoformer and Informer improve generalization but suffer from quadratic complexity and degraded performance on very long time horizons. State space models, notably S-Mamba, provide linear-time updates but often face unstable training dynamics, sensitivity to initialization, and limited robustness for multivariate forecasting. To address such challenges, we propose the Quantum-Optimized Selective State Space Model (Q-SSM), a hybrid quantum-optimized approach that integrates state space dynamics with a variational quantum gate. Instead of relying on expensive attention mechanisms, Q-SSM employs a simple parametrized quantum circuit (RY-RX ansatz) whose expectation values regulate memory updates adaptively. This quantum gating mechanism improves convergence stability, enhances the modeling of long-term dependencies, and provides a lightweight alternative to attention. We empirically validate Q-SSM on three widely used benchmarks, i.e., ETT, Traffic, and Exchange Rate. Results show that Q-SSM consistently improves over strong baselines (LSTM, TCN, Reformer), Transformer-based models, and S-Mamba. These findings demonstrate that variational quantum gating can address current limitations in long-range forecasting, leading to accurate and robust multivariate predictions.</p></details> |  |

We show that speech foundation models learn representations that are domain-independent and achieve state-of-the-art performance on time series tasks from wearable sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0 outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on modality specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and activity classification tasks. We find a particularly strong relevance of the convolutional feature encoders from speech models for wearable sensor tasks. The methods proposed here improve performance and robustness for data-scarce time series tasks, using simple probing methods.

Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified, experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level, even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series data.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, Time-series Reasoning for Anomaly (Time-RA) that transforms classical time series anomaly detection from a discriminative into a generative, reasoning-intensive task leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Also, we introduce the first real-world multimodal benchmark dataset, RATs40K, explicitly annotated for anomaly reasoning, comprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each sample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and visual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types for univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured explanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework utilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback, ensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current models, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning. Our dataset and task pave the way for significant advancements in interpretable time series anomaly detection and reasoning.

| **[Learning to Coordinate: Distributed Meta-Trajectory Optimization Via Differentiable ADMM-DDP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01630v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Acceleration Preconditioners for Parametric Radiative Transfer Equations based on Trajectory-Aware Reduced Order Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05001v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The parametric radiative transfer equation (RTE) arises in multi-query applications, such as design optimization, inverse problems, and uncertainty quantification, which require solving the RTE multiple times for various parameters. Classical synthetic acceleration (SA) preconditioners are designed based on low-order approximations of a kinetic correction equation, e.g., its diffusion limit in diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA). Despite their widespread success, these methods rely on empirical physical assumptions and do not leverage low-rank structures across parameters of the parametric problem. To address these limitations, our previous work introduced a reduced-order model (ROM) enhanced preconditioner called ROMSAD, which exploits low-rank structures across parameters and the original kinetic description of the correction equation. While ROMSAD improves overall efficiency compared with DSA, its efficiency reduces after the first iteration, because the construction of the underlying ROM ignores the preconditioner-dependence of the residual trajectory, leading to a mismatch between the offline and online residual trajectories. To overcome this issue, we introduce a trajectory-aware framework that iteratively constructs ROMs to eliminate the mismatch between offline and online residual trajectories. Numerical tests demonstrate superior efficiency over DSA, and substantial gains in both efficiency and robustness over ROMSAD. For a parametric lattice problem, trajectory-aware ROM preconditioners achieve rapid convergence within only $2$-$3$ iterations online.</p></details> | 32 pages, 9 figures |

While human-motion-centric approaches excel in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods. Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.</p></details> |  |

STO maintains the maneuver strategy of the high-level global planner while allowing curvature discontinuities at switching points to improve maneuver efficiency. To ensure safety, a convex corridor is constructed via GJK-accelerated ellipse shrinking and expansion, serving as safety constraints in each iteration. Numerical simulations in perpendicular and reverse-angled parking scenarios demonstrate that STO enhances maneuver efficiency while ensuring safety. Moreover, computational performance confirms its practicality for real-world applications.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Robust Offline Imitation Learning Through State-level Trajectory Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22524v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning (IL) has proven effective for enabling robots to acquire visuomotor skills through expert demonstrations. However, traditional IL methods are limited by their reliance on high-quality, often scarce, expert data, and suffer from covariate shift. To address these challenges, recent advances in offline IL have incorporated suboptimal, unlabeled datasets into the training. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance policy learning from mixed-quality offline datasets by leveraging task-relevant trajectory fragments and rich environmental dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a state-based search framework that stitches state-action pairs from imperfect demonstrations, generating more diverse and informative training trajectories. Experimental results on standard IL benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks showcase that our proposed method significantly improves both generalization and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Virtuoso: A Latent Diffusion Transformer Model for Goal-Conditioned Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03658v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems. While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity, computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present the \textbf{Efficient Virtuoso}, a conditional latent diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, reaching a \textbf{minADE of 0.25}. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can the Waymo Open Motion Dataset Support Realistic Behavioral Modeling? A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03515v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations. Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably, WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving. Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without proper validation against independently collected data.</p></details> |  |

For control purposes, the model is structured as a cascade system, where a rotational subsystem drives a translational one. The rotational subsystem is linear, while the translational subsystem follows a linear-plus-perturbation form, thereby reducing the complexity of control design. A control strategy requiring only simple operations, no memory, and no iterative search loops is presented to illustrate the main features of the GA model. By employing GA to model both translations and rotations, a singularity-free and geometrically intuitive representation can be achieved through the use of the geometric product. Closed-loop stability is rigorously established using input-to-state stability methods. Numerical simulations of a quad tilt-rotorcraft performing trajectory tracking in a windy environment validate the controller's stability and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE TAES for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[KEPT: Knowledge-Enhanced Prediction of Trajectories from Consecutive Driving Frames with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02966v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars. Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion, and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset, KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising, data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

How about solving such a problem at an incredibly fast computational time? On a small form-factor processor? Algorithmic details that make possible this trifecta of breakthroughs are presented in this paper. The computational mathematics that deliver these advancements are: (i) a Birkhoff-theoretic discretization of optimal control problems, (ii) matrix-free linear algebra leveraging Krylov-subspace methods, and (iii) a near-perfect Birkhoff preconditioner that helps achieve $\mathcal{O}(1)$ iteration speed with respect to the grid size,~$N$. A key enabler of this high performance is the computation of Birkhoff matrix-vector products at $\mathcal{O}(N\log(N))$ time using fast Fourier transform techniques that eliminate traditional computational bottlenecks.

Still, existing data-driven models are constrained mainly to single-vessel forecasting, overlooking vessel interactions, navigation rules, and explicit collision risk assessment. We present a transformer-based framework for multi-vessel trajectory prediction with integrated collision risk analysis. For a given target vessel, the framework identifies nearby vessels. It jointly predicts their future trajectories through parallel streams encoding kinematic and derived physical features, causal convolutions for temporal locality, spatial transformations for positional encoding, and hybrid positional embeddings that capture both local motion patterns and long-range dependencies. Evaluated on large-scale real-world AIS data using joint multi-vessel metrics, the model demonstrates superior forecasting capabilities beyond traditional single-vessel displacement errors. By simulating interactions among predicted trajectories, the framework further quantifies potential collision risks, offering actionable insights to strengthen maritime safety and decision support.</p></details> |  |

An MPC strategy based on a 12-dimensional prediction model is proposed for the outer loop, explicitly accounting for time-varying coupled constraints, where multiple variables are interdependent and need to be handled together. The outer-loop controller generates an acceleration reference, which is then converted into attitude and angular velocity references, later tracked by a nonlinear inner-loop controller. Numerical simulations validate the approach, demonstrating enhanced performance in precise and fast tracking by imposing less conservative constraints than existing approaches, while still guaranteeing stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, submitted to 2025 IEEE 64th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)</p></details> |
| **[Relative Trajectory Balance is equivalent to Trust-PCL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01632v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in generative modeling has highlighted the importance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for fine-tuning, with KL-regularized methods in particular proving to be highly effective for both autoregressive and diffusion models. Complementing this line of work, the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB) objective was recently introduced in the context of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to serve the same role of improving fine-tuning in sequential generative models. Building on prior work linking GFlowNets and maximum-entropy RL, we establish in this paper an equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL, an off-policy RL method with KL regularization. This equivalence situates RTB within the broader theoretical landscape of KL-regularized RL, and clarifies its relationship to earlier methods. Leveraging this insight, we revisit an illustrative example from the RTB paper and show that KL-regularized RL methods achieve comparable performance, offering an alternative perspective to what was previously reported.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using iterated local alignment to aggregate trajectory data into a traffic flow map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17500v6)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectories are a promising GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) data source to compute multi-scale traffic flow maps ranging from the city/regional level to the road level. The main obstacle is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for city level, large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial difficulties for road level, small-scale aggregation. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales for static and interactive maps.</p></details> |  |

While general-purpose deep research agents have shown impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored for medical contexts. We present a medical deep research agent that addresses these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool interactions. Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Metamorphic Testing of Multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01294v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Predicting human trajectories is crucial for the safety and reliability of autonomous systems, such as automated vehicles and mobile robots. However, rigorously testing the underlying multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) models, which typically use multiple input sources (e.g., trajectory history and environment maps) and produce stochastic outputs (multiple possible future paths), presents significant challenges. The primary difficulty lies in the absence of a definitive test oracle, as numerous future trajectories might be plausible for any given scenario. Objectives: This research presents the application of Metamorphic Testing (MT) as a systematic methodology for testing multimodal HTP systems. We address the oracle problem through metamorphic relations (MRs) adapted for the complexities and stochastic nature of HTP. Methods: We present five MRs, targeting transformations of both historical trajectory data and semantic segmentation maps used as an environmental context. These MRs encompass: 1) label-preserving geometric transformations (mirroring, rotation, rescaling) applied to both trajectory and map inputs, where outputs are expected to transform correspondingly. 2) Map-altering transformations (changing semantic class labels, introducing obstacles) with predictable changes in trajectory distributions. We propose probabilistic violation criteria based on distance metrics between probability distributions, such as the Wasserstein or Hellinger distance. Conclusion: This study introduces tool, a MT framework for the oracle-less testing of multimodal, stochastic HTP systems. It allows for assessment of model robustness against input transformations and contextual changes without reliance on ground-truth trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Infor...</summary><p>Information and Software Technology</p></details> |

An innovative geometric indicator, based on the analysis of safety zones using adaptive ellipses, is used to accurately quantify collision risks. Our method applies the Shoelace formula to compute the intersection area in the case of misaligned and time-varying configurations. Comfort is modeled using indicators centered on longitudinal and lateral jerk, while efficiency is assessed by overall travel time. These criteria are aggregated into a comprehensive objective function solved using a PSO based algorithm. The approach was successfully validated under real traffic conditions via experiments conducted in an urban intersection involving an autonomous vehicle interacting with a human-operated vehicle, and in simulation using data recorded from human driving in real traffic.</p></details> |  |

The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association. MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition, MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

We assume that we are given a path in the form of a set of line segments that the end-effector should follow. We also assume that we have a method to solve the inverse kinematic problem of the manipulator at each via-point of the trajectory. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, we calculate the feasible region of the manipulator under a specific configuration of the end-effector. Next, we aim to find a trajectory on the line segments and a sequence of joint configurations the manipulator should follow to move the end-effector along the specified trajectory. Finally, we find the optimal combination of solutions to the inverse kinematic problem at each via-point along the trajectory by reducing the problem to a shortest-path problem of the graph and applying Dijkstra's algorithm. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by experiments.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[A Risk-aware Spatial-temporal Trajectory Planning Framework for Autonomous Vehicles Using QP-MPC and Dynamic Hazard Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00643v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning is a critical component in ensuring the safety, stability, and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. While existing trajectory planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i) a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives, providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.</p></details> |  |

Although data acquisition using drones is efficient, existing datasets still have limitations in scene representativeness, information richness, and data fidelity. This study introduces FLUID, comprising a fine-grained trajectory dataset that captures dense conflicts at typical urban signalized intersections, and a lightweight, full-pipeline framework for drone-based trajectory processing. FLUID covers three distinct intersection types, with approximately 5 hours of recording time and featuring over 20,000 TPs across 8 categories. Notably, the dataset averages two vehicle conflicts per minute, involving roughly 25% of all motor vehicles. FLUID provides comprehensive data, including trajectories, traffic signals, maps, and raw videos. Comparison with the DataFromSky platform and ground-truth measurements validates its high spatio-temporal accuracy. Through a detailed classification of motor vehicle conflicts and violations, FLUID reveals a diversity of interactive behaviors, demonstrating its value for human preference mining, traffic behavior modeling, and autonomous driving research.</p></details> | 26 pages, 14 figures |

Using the two-scale Lorenz '96 system as a case study, we develop and train both additive and multiplicative stochastic parametrizations to generate ensemble predictions. Results indicate that CRPS-based trajectory learning produces parametrizations that are both accurate and sharp. The resulting parametrizations are straightforward to calibrate and outperform derivative-fitting-based parametrizations in short-term forecasts.

| **[Temporal Flow Matching for Learning Spatio-Temporal Trajectories in 4D Longitudinal Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21580v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions. While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e. predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports $3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamics-Compliant Trajectory Diffusion for Super-Nominal Payload Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21375v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nominal payload ratings for articulated robots are typically derived from worst-case configurations, resulting in uniform payload constraints across the entire workspace. This conservative approach severely underutilizes the robot's inherent capabilities -- our analysis demonstrates that manipulators can safely handle payloads well above nominal capacity across broad regions of their workspace while staying within joint angle, velocity, acceleration, and torque limits. To address this gap between assumed and actual capability, we propose a novel trajectory generation approach using denoising diffusion models that explicitly incorporates payload constraints into the planning process. Unlike traditional sampling-based methods that rely on inefficient trial-and-error, optimization-based methods that are prohibitively slow, or kinodynamic planners that struggle with problem dimensionality, our approach generates dynamically feasible joint-space trajectories in constant time that can be directly executed on physical hardware without post-processing. Experimental validation on a 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrates that up to 67.6% of the workspace remains accessible even with payloads exceeding 3 times the nominal capacity. This expanded operational envelope highlights the importance of a more nuanced consideration of payload dynamics in motion planning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 Conference on Robot Learning [CoRL]</p></details> |
| **[BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05762v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Manifold Trajectories in Next-Token Prediction: From Replicator Dynamics to Softmax Equilibrium](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21186v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comparative Study of Spline-Based Trajectory Reconstruction Methods Across Varying Automatic Vehicle Location Data Densities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00119v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic vehicle location (AVL) data offers insights into transit dynamics, but its effectiveness is often hampered by inconsistent update frequencies, necessitating trajectory reconstruction. This research evaluates 13 trajectory reconstruction methods, including several novel approaches, using high-resolution AVL data from Austin, Texas. We examine the interplay of four critical factors -- velocity, position, smoothing, and data density -- on reconstruction performance. A key contribution of this study is evaluation of these methods across sparse and dense datasets, providing insights into the trade-off between accuracy and resource allocation. Our evaluation framework combines traditional mathematical error metrics for positional and velocity with practical considerations, such as physical realism (e.g., aligning velocity and acceleration with stopped states, deceleration rates, and speed variability). In addition, we provide insight into the relative value of each method in calculating realistic metrics for infrastructure evaluations. Our findings indicate that velocity-aware methods consistently outperform position-only approaches. Interestingly, we discovered that smoothing-based methods can degrade overall performance in complex, congested urban environments, although enforcing monotonicity remains critical. The velocity constrained Hermite interpolation with monotonicity enforcement (VCHIP-ME) yields optimal results, offering a balance between high accuracy and computational efficiency. Its minimal overhead makes it suitable for both historical analysis and real-time applications, providing significant predictive power when combined with dense datasets. These findings offer practical guidance for researchers and practitioners implementing trajectory reconstruction systems and emphasize the importance of investing in higher-frequency AVL data collection for improved analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeMat-Traj: A Scalable and Unified Dataset of Materials Trajectories for Atomistic Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20875v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs. LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LeMaterial/LeMat-Traj and https://github.com/LeMaterial/lematerial-fetcher.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Trajectory Prediction via Rule-Regularized Heteroscedastic Deep Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13111v3)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising capabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher.

The investigation of these dynamics can provide a better understanding of diffusing objects and their surrounding media, but a quantitative characterization from individual trajectories is often challenging. Efforts devoted to improving anomalous diffusion detection using classical statistics and machine learning have produced several new methods. Recently, the anomalous diffusion challenge (AnDi, www.andi-challenge.org) was launched to objectively assess these approaches on a common dataset, focusing on three aspects of anomalous diffusion: the inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent; the classification of the diffusion model; and the segmentation of trajectories. In this article, I describe a simple approach to tackle the tasks of the AnDi challenge by combining extreme learning machine and feature engineering (AnDi-ELM). The method reaches satisfactory performance while offering a straightforward implementation and fast training time with limited computing resources, making it a suitable tool for fast preliminary screening of anomalous diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Ego-centric Predictive Model Conditioned on Hand Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19852v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In egocentric scenarios, anticipating both the next action and its visual outcome is essential for understanding human-object interactions and for enabling robotic planning. However, existing paradigms fall short of jointly modeling these aspects. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models focus on action prediction but lack explicit modeling of how actions influence the visual scene, while video prediction models generate future frames without conditioning on specific actions, often resulting in implausible or contextually inconsistent outcomes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified two-stage predictive framework that jointly models action and visual future in egocentric scenarios, conditioned on hand trajectories. In the first stage, we perform consecutive state modeling to process heterogeneous inputs (visual observations, language, and action history) and explicitly predict future hand trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce causal cross-attention to fuse multi-modal cues, leveraging inferred action signals to guide an image-based Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for frame-by-frame future video generation. Our approach is the first unified model designed to handle both egocentric human activity understanding and robotic manipulation tasks, providing explicit predictions of both upcoming actions and their visual consequences. Extensive experiments on Ego4D, BridgeData, and RLBench demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both action prediction and future video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: github.com/showlab/Ego-PM</p></details> |

To provide an optimized solution, we propose a cooperative trajectory optimization and task allocation framework leveraging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). This study integrates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for efficient task allocation among multiple UAVs and UGVs, and employs an informed-RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star) algorithm for collision-free trajectory generation. Further optimization of task sequencing and path efficiency is conducted using Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Simulation experiments conducted in a realistic post-disaster environment demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves the overall efficiency of medical rescue operations compared to traditional strategies. Specifically, our method reduces the total mission completion time to 26.7 minutes for a 15-task scenario, outperforming K-Means clustering and random allocation by over 73%. Furthermore, the framework achieves a substantial 15.1% reduction in total traveled distance after CMA-ES optimization. The cooperative utilization of UAVs and UGVs effectively balances their complementary advantages, highlighting the system's scalability and practicality for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Trust Region Sequential Convex Optimization for Multi-Drone Thermal Screening Trajectory Planning in Urban Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06012v3)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid detection of abnormal body temperatures in urban populations is essential for managing public health risks, especially during outbreaks of infectious diseases. Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance, coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas.

| **[Coresets from Trajectories: Selecting Data via Correlation of Loss Differences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20230v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k, CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with <1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints, incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled, efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion: Real-Time Trajectory Planning with Just-Enough Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12166v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots equipped with rich sensor suites can localize reliably in partially-observable environments, but powering every sensor continuously is wasteful and often infeasible. Belief-space planners address this by propagating pose-belief covariance through analytic models and switching sensors heuristically--a brittle, runtime-expensive approach. Data-driven approaches--including diffusion models--learn multi-modal trajectories from demonstrations, but presuppose an accurate, always-on state estimate. We address the largely open problem: for a given task in a mapped environment, which \textit{minimal sensor subset} must be active at each location to maintain state uncertainty \textit{just low enough} to complete the task? Our key insight is that when a diffusion planner is explicitly conditioned on a pose-belief raster and a sensor mask, the spread of its denoising trajectories yields a calibrated, differentiable proxy for the expected localisation error. Building on this insight, we present Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion (B-COD), the first planner that, in a 10 ms forward pass, returns a short-horizon trajectory, per-waypoint aleatoric variances, and a proxy for localisation error--eliminating external covariance rollouts. We show that this single proxy suffices for a soft-actor-critic to choose sensors online, optimising energy while bounding pose-covariance growth. We deploy B-COD in real-time marine trials on an unmanned surface vehicle and show that it reduces sensing energy consumption while matching the goal-reach performance of an always-on baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025 (Conference on Robot Learning)</p></details> |

The task of predicting pedestrian crossing intention involves determining whether pedestrians in the scene are likely to cross the road or not. In this work, we propose TrajFusionNet, a novel transformer-based model that combines future pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed predictions as priors for predicting crossing intention. TrajFusionNet comprises two branches: a Sequence Attention Module (SAM) and a Visual Attention Module (VAM). The SAM branch learns from a sequential representation of the observed and predicted pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed. Complementarily, the VAM branch enables learning from a visual representation of the predicted pedestrian trajectory by overlaying predicted pedestrian bounding boxes onto scene images. By utilizing a small number of lightweight modalities, TrajFusionNet achieves the lowest total inference time (including model runtime and data preprocessing) among current state-of-the-art approaches. In terms of performance, it achieves state-of-the-art results across the three most commonly used datasets for pedestrian crossing intention prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles for possible publication</p></details> |

In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces the Trajectory-to-Action Pipeline (TAP), a scalable and automated method for extracting SDL labels from large trajectory datasets. TAP applies a rules-based cross-entropy optimization approach to learn parameters directly from data, enhancing generalization across diverse driving contexts. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), TAP achieves 30% greater precision than Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 24% over Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in identifying behaviorally similar trajectories. Additionally, TAP enables automated detection of unique driving behaviors, streamlining safety evaluation processes for AV testing. This work provides a foundation for scalable scenario-based AV behavior analysis, with potential extensions for integrating multi-agent contexts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Medical doctors guide these conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including annotation guidelines, publicly available at https://github.com/DATEXIS/medical-intent-classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |

By segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process. To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change, motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single, single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200 frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space design validation in crowd dynamics research.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we consider a single UAV with 3 degree-of-freedom dynamics tasked with delivering blood packages to multiple hospitals, each with a predefined time window and priority. Mission objectives are encoded using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enabling the formal specification of spatial-temporal constraints. To ensure safety, city buildings are modeled as 3D convex obstacles, and obstacle avoidance is handled through a Convex Feasible Set (CFS) method. The entire planning problem-combining UAV dynamics, STL satisfaction, and collision avoidance-is formulated as a convex optimization problem that ensures tractability and can be solved efficiently using standard convex programming techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method generates dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories that satisfy temporal mission goals, providing a scalable and reliable approach for autonomous UAV-based medical logistics.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Dynamic Trajectory Optimization and Power Control for Hierarchical UAV Swarms in 6G Aerial Access Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18702v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can serve as aerial base stations (BSs) to extend the ubiquitous connectivity for ground users (GUs) in the sixth-generation (6G) era. However, it is challenging to cooperatively deploy multiple UAV swarms in large-scale remote areas. Hence, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical UAV swarms structure for 6G aerial access networks, where the head UAVs serve as aerial BSs, and tail UAVs (T-UAVs) are responsible for relay. In detail, we jointly optimize the dynamic deployment and trajectory of UAV swarms, which is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) to concurrently minimize the energy consumption of UAV swarms and GUs, as well as the delay of GUs. However, the proposed MOP is a mixed integer nonlinear programming and NP-hard to solve. Therefore, we develop a K-means and Voronoi diagram based area division method, and construct Fermat points to establish connections between GUs and T-UAVs. Then, an improved non-dominated sorting whale optimization algorithm is proposed to seek Pareto optimal solutions for the transformed MOP. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to verify the performance of proposed algorithms by comparing with baseline mechanisms, resulting in a 50% complexity reduction.</p></details> |  |

Our framework features a unified trajectory representation that encapsulates the kinematic models of both $SO(3)\times\mathbb{R}^3$ and $SE(3)$ pose representations. This encapsulation strategy allows users to use the same implementation of measurement-based factors for either choice of pose representation, which facilitates experimentation and comparison to achieve the best model for the ME task. In addition, unique to our framework, we derive the kinematic models with the closed-form temporal derivatives of the local variable of $SO(3)$ and $SE(3)$, which so far has only been approximated based on the Taylor expansion in the literature. Our experiments show that these kinematic models can improve the estimation accuracy in high-speed scenarios. All analytical Jacobians of the interpolated states with respect to the support states of the trajectory representation, as well as the motion prior factors, are also provided for accelerated Gauss-Newton (GN) optimization. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the framework in various motion estimation tasks such as localization, calibration, and odometry, facilitating fast prototyping for ME researchers. We release the source code for the benefit of the community.

Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved promising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual manipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual manipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and objects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and objects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of diffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM) to schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding pairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically generated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase in success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world tasks further verify its practical value by improving the success rate by 32.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website is at: https://denghaoyuan123.github.io/SafeBimanip/</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Output Steps: FlexiSteps Network for Dynamic Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17797v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is vital for autonomous driving, robotics, and intelligent decision-making systems, yet traditional models typically rely on fixed-length output predictions, limiting their adaptability to dynamic real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the FlexiSteps Network (FSN), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts prediction output time steps based on varying contextual conditions. Inspired by recent advancements addressing observation length discrepancies and dynamic feature extraction, FSN incorporates an pre-trained Adaptive Prediction Module (APM) to evaluate and adjust the output steps dynamically, ensuring optimal prediction accuracy and efficiency. To guarantee the plug-and-play of our FSN, we also design a Dynamic Decoder(DD). Additionally, to balance the prediction time steps and prediction accuracy, we design a scoring mechanism, which not only introduces the Fr\'echet distance to evaluate the geometric similarity between the predicted trajectories and the ground truth trajectories but the length of predicted steps is also considered. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including Argoverse and INTERACTION demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed FSN framework.</p></details> |  |

However, existing works suffer from the generalization problem, \ie, they are either restricted to train for specific regions or only suitable for a few tasks. Given the recent advances of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we raise the question: can MLLMs reform current trajectory data mining and solve the problem? Nevertheless, due to the modality gap of trajectory, how to generate task-independent multimodal trajectory representations and how to adapt flexibly to different tasks remain the foundational challenges. In this paper, we propose \texttt{Traj-MLLM}}, which is the first general framework using MLLMs for trajectory data mining. By integrating multiview contexts, \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} transforms raw trajectories into interleaved image-text sequences while preserving key spatial-temporal characteristics, and directly utilizes the reasoning ability of MLLMs for trajectory analysis. Additionally, a prompt optimization method is proposed to finalize data-invariant prompts for task adaptation. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets show that \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by $48.05\%$, $15.52\%$, $51.52\%$, $1.83\%$ on travel time estimation, mobility prediction, anomaly detection and transportation mode identification, respectively. \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} achieves these superior performances without requiring any training data or fine-tuning the MLLM backbones.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |
| **[OmniCache: A Trajectory-Oriented Global Perspective on Training-Free Cache Reuse for Diffusion Transformer Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16212v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process. Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the sampling procedure. In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Preference Trajectory Modeling via Flow Matching for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17618v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation predicts each user's next item based on their historical interaction sequence. Recently, diffusion models have attracted significant attention in this area due to their strong ability to model user interest distributions. They typically generate target items by denoising Gaussian noise conditioned on historical interactions. However, these models face two critical limitations. First, they exhibit high sensitivity to the condition, making it difficult to recover target items from pure Gaussian noise. Second, the inference process is computationally expensive, limiting practical deployment. To address these issues, we propose FlowRec, a simple yet effective sequential recommendation framework which leverages flow matching to explicitly model user preference trajectories from current states to future interests. Flow matching is an emerging generative paradigm, which offers greater flexibility in initial distributions and enables more efficient sampling. Based on this, we construct a personalized behavior-based prior distribution to replace Gaussian noise and learn a vector field to model user preference trajectories. To better align flow matching with the recommendation objective, we further design a single-step alignment loss incorporating both positive and negative samples, improving sampling efficiency and generation quality. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify the superiority of FlowRec over the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02085v5)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/JARVIS-Xs/SE-Agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReviBranch: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Branch-and-Bound with Revived Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17452v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm is the main solver for Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs), where the selection of branching variable is essential to computational efficiency. However, traditional heuristics for branching often fail to generalize across heterogeneous problem instances, while existing learning-based methods such as imitation learning (IL) suffers from dependence on expert demonstration quality, and reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with limitations in sparse rewards and dynamic state representation challenges. To address these issues, we propose ReviBranch, a novel deep RL framework that constructs revived trajectories by reviving explicit historical correspondences between branching decisions and their corresponding graph states along search-tree paths. During training, ReviBranch enables agents to learn from complete structural evolution and temporal dependencies within the branching process. Additionally, we introduce an importance-weighted reward redistribution mechanism that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense stepwise feedback, addressing the sparse reward challenge. Extensive experiments on different MILP benchmarks demonstrate that ReviBranch outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, reducing B&B nodes by 4.0% and LP iterations by 2.2% on large-scale instances. The results highlight the robustness and generalizability of ReviBranch across heterogeneous MILP problem classes.</p></details> | conference |

Natural language enables users to express these adjustments in an interactive manner. We introduce OVITA, an interpretable, open-vocabulary, language-driven framework designed for adapting robot trajectories in dynamic and novel situations based on human instructions. OVITA leverages multiple pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate user commands into trajectories generated by motion planners or those learned through demonstrations. OVITA employs code as an adaptation policy generated by an LLM, enabling users to adjust individual waypoints, thus providing flexible control. Another LLM, which acts as a code explainer, removes the need for expert users, enabling intuitive interactions. The efficacy and significance of the proposed OVITA framework is demonstrated through extensive simulations and real-world environments with diverse tasks involving spatiotemporal variations on heterogeneous robotic platforms such as a KUKA IIWA robot manipulator, Clearpath Jackal ground robot, and CrazyFlie drone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics and Automation Letters 2025.

Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG) representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF) design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups, and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving high fidelity along the original trajectory.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Rapid Iterative Trajectory Planning Method for Automated Parking through Differential Flatness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17038v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous driving continues to advance, automated parking is becoming increasingly essential. However, significant challenges arise when implementing path velocity decomposition (PVD) trajectory planning for automated parking. The primary challenge is ensuring rapid and precise collision-free trajectory planning, which is often in conflict. The secondary challenge involves maintaining sufficient control feasibility of the planned trajectory, particularly at gear shifting points (GSP). This paper proposes a PVD-based rapid iterative trajectory planning (RITP) method to solve the above challenges. The proposed method effectively balances the necessity for time efficiency and precise collision avoidance through a novel collision avoidance framework. Moreover, it enhances the overall control feasibility of the planned trajectory by incorporating the vehicle kinematics model and including terminal smoothing constraints (TSC) at GSP during path planning. Specifically, the proposed method leverages differential flatness to ensure the planned path adheres to the vehicle kinematic model. Additionally, it utilizes TSC to maintain curvature continuity at GSP, thereby enhancing the control feasibility of the overall trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate superior time efficiency and tracking errors compared to model-integrated and other iteration-based trajectory planning methods. In the real-world experiment, the proposed method was implemented and validated on a ROS-based vehicle, demonstrating the applicability of the RITP method for real vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the journal Robotics and Autonomous Systems</p></details> |

The framework is built upon Large Language Models (LLMs), incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowered by Agentic AI and integrated with a UAV-specific knowledge base. Through the Agentic RAG, the LLM autonomously interprets high-level task requirements and identifies the key components necessary for trajectory optimization, including model inputs and outputs, network architecture, reward functions, and task constraints. To support efficient modeling across different system scales, we introduce the Mamba-Attention Integrated Transformer (MAIT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines the long-range dependency modeling capability of attention mechanisms with the efficient temporal dynamic representation of Mamba. Furthermore, a Trajectory-Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) method is proposed to achieve unified policy gradient optimization in both discrete and continuous trajectory spaces for MAIT training. Extensive experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ARMAIT framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrated Take-off Management and Trajectory Optimization for Merging Control in Urban Air Mobility Corridors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15395v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has the potential to revolutionize daily transportation, offering rapid and efficient aerial mobility services. Take-off and merging phases are critical for air corridor operations, requiring the coordination of take-off aircraft and corridor traffic while ensuring safety and seamless transition. This paper proposes an integrated take-off management and trajectory optimization for merging control in UAM corridors. We first introduce a novel take-off airspace design. To our knowledge, this paper is one of the first to propose a structured design for take-off airspace. Based on the take-off airspace design, we devise a hierarchical coordinated take-off and merging management (HCTMM) strategy. To be specific, the take-off airspace design can simplify aircraft dynamics and thus reduce the dimensionality of the trajectory optimization problem whilst mitigating obstacle avoidance complexities. The HCTMM strategy strictly ensures safety and improves the efficiency of take-off and merging operations. At the tactical level, a scheduling algorithm coordinates aircraft take-off times and selects dynamic merging points to reduce conflicts and ensure smooth take-off and merging processes. At the operational level, a trajectory optimization strategy ensures that each aircraft reaches the dynamic merging point efficiently while satisfying safety constraints. Simulation results show that, compared to representative strategies with fixed or dynamic merging points, the HCTMM strategy significantly improves operational efficiency and reduces computational burden, while ensuring safety under various corridor traffic conditions. Further results confirm the scalability of the HCTMM strategy and the computational efficiency enabled by the proposed take-off airspace design.</p></details> | 31 pages |

Most models predict chronological age, an imperfect surrogate for biological aging, or generate synthetic MRIs that enhance data diversity but fail to capture subject-specific trajectories. Here, we present BrainPath, a 3D generative framework that learns longitudinal brain aging dynamics during training and, at inference, predicts anatomically faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan. BrainPath integrates an age calibration loss, a swap learning strategy, and an age perceptual loss to preserve subtle, biologically meaningful variations. Across held-out ADNI and an independent NACC dataset, BrainPath outperforms state-of-the-art reference models in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns. Beyond methodological innovation, BrainPath enables personalized mapping of brain aging, synthetic follow-up scan prediction, and trajectory-based analyses, providing a foundation for precision modeling of brain aging and supporting research into neurodegeneration and aging interventions.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided hierarchical planning framework for robust spatial-temporal obstacle avoidance. In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance and fast parallel computation. Furthermore, an incremental multi-branch trajectory management framework is introduced to enable spatio-temporal topological decision-making, while efficiently leveraging historical information to reduce replanning time. Simulation results show that TRUST-Planner outperforms baseline competitors, achieving a 96\% success rate and millisecond-level computation efficiency in tested complex environments.

Even though most traffic accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention, as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions -- and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.</p></details> |  |

Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and most existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by UAI 2025.

All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be guaranteed.

The deep Koopman operator is trained on sampled flight data to construct a high-dimensional latent representation in which the nonlinear quadrotor dynamics are approximated by linear models. This linearization enables the application of MPC to efficiently optimize control actions over a finite prediction horizon, ensuring accurate trajectory tracking and stabilization. The proposed DK-MPC approach is validated through a series of trajectory-following and point-stabilization numerical experiments, where it demonstrates superior tracking accuracy and significantly lower computation time compared to conventional nonlinear MPC. These results highlight the potential of Koopman-based learning methods to handle complex quadrotor dynamics while meeting the real-time requirements of embedded flight control. Future work will focus on extending the framework to more agile flight scenarios and improving robustness against external disturbances.</p></details> |  |

We introduce BiND (Bimanual Neural Discriminator-Decoder), a two-stage model that first classifies motion type (unimanual left, unimanual right, or bimanual) and then uses specialized GRU-based decoders, augmented with a trial-relative time index, to predict continuous 2D hand velocities. We benchmark BiND against six state-of-the-art models (SVR, XGBoost, FNN, CNN, Transformer, GRU) on a publicly available 13-session intracortical dataset from a tetraplegic patient. BiND achieves a mean $R^2$ of 0.76 ($\pm$0.01) for unimanual and 0.69 ($\pm$0.03) for bimanual trajectory prediction, surpassing the next-best model (GRU) by 2% in both tasks. It also demonstrates greater robustness to session variability than all other benchmarked models, with accuracy improvements of up to 4% compared to GRU in cross-session analyses.

Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world Argoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark comparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2025 IEEE.

| **[Rapid Urban Visibility Hotspots: Quantifying Building Vertex Visibility from Connected Vehicle Trajectories using Spatial Indexing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03365v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective placement of Out-of-Home advertising and street furniture requires accurate identification of locations offering maximum visual exposure to target audiences, particularly vehicular traffic. Traditional site selection methods often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity) radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings: 1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots' receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2) The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Tube Visualization of Particle Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13505v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel, computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROVER: Robust Loop Closure Verification with Trajectory Prior in Repetitive Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13488v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes, achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity. Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter, we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are available at https://github.com/jarvisyjw/ROVER.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Adaptive Conformal Prediction Intervals Over Trajectory Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13362v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. By introducing a novel online update step and an optimization step that captures inter-step dependencies, our method can produce discontinuous prediction intervals around each trajectory, naturally capture temporal dependencies, and yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRAP: Robot Sub-Trajectory Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15182v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning is witnessing a significant increase in the size, diversity, and complexity of pre-collected datasets, mirroring trends in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Many robot learning methods treat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task, generalist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the "sub"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve sub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion. STRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning methods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much larger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn robust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at https://weirdlabuw.github.io/strap/</p></details> |
| **[Latent Plan Transformer for Trajectory Abstraction: Planning as Latent Space Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04647v4)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In tasks aiming for long-term returns, planning becomes essential. We study generative modeling for planning with datasets repurposed from offline reinforcement learning. Specifically, we identify temporal consistency in the absence of step-wise rewards as one key technical challenge. We introduce the Latent Plan Transformer (LPT), a novel model that leverages a latent variable to connect a Transformer-based trajectory generator and the final return. LPT can be learned with maximum likelihood estimation on trajectory-return pairs. In learning, posterior sampling of the latent variable naturally integrates sub-trajectories to form a consistent abstraction despite the finite context. At test time, the latent variable is inferred from an expected return before policy execution, realizing the idea of planning as inference. Our experiments demonstrate that LPT can discover improved decisions from sub-optimal trajectories, achieving competitive performance across several benchmarks, including Gym-Mujoco, Franka Kitchen, Maze2D, and Connect Four. It exhibits capabilities in nuanced credit assignments, trajectory stitching, and adaptation to environmental contingencies. These results validate that latent variable inference can be a strong alternative to step-wise reward prompting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autonomous Oil Spill Response Through Liquid Neural Trajectory Modeling and Coordinated Marine Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12456v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Marine oil spills pose grave environmental and economic risks, threatening marine ecosystems, coastlines, and dependent industries. Predicting and managing oil spill trajectories is highly complex, due to the interplay of physical, chemical, and environmental factors such as wind, currents, and temperature, which makes timely and effective response challenging. Accurate real-time trajectory forecasting and coordinated mitigation are vital for minimizing the impact of these disasters. This study introduces an integrated framework combining a multi-agent swarm robotics system built on the MOOS-IvP platform with Liquid Time-Constant Neural Networks (LTCNs). The proposed system fuses adaptive machine learning with autonomous marine robotics, enabling real-time prediction, dynamic tracking, and rapid response to evolving oil spills. By leveraging LTCNs--well-suited for modeling complex, time-dependent processes--the framework achieves real-time, high-accuracy forecasts of spill movement. Swarm intelligence enables decentralized, scalable, and resilient decision-making among robot agents, enhancing collective monitoring and containment efforts. Our approach was validated using data from the Deepwater Horizon spill, where the LTC-RK4 model achieved 0.96 spatial accuracy, surpassing LSTM approaches by 23%. The integration of advanced neural modeling with autonomous, coordinated robotics demonstrates substantial improvements in prediction precision, flexibility, and operational scalability. Ultimately, this research advances the state-of-the-art for sustainable, autonomous oil spill management and environmental protection by enhancing both trajectory prediction and response coordination.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 40 figures.

| **[FSDP: Fast and Safe Data-Driven Overtaking Trajectory Planning for Head-to-Head Autonomous Racing Competitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06075v2)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating overtaking trajectories in autonomous racing is a challenging task, as the trajectory must satisfy the vehicle's dynamics and ensure safety and real-time performance running on resource-constrained hardware. This work proposes the Fast and Safe Data-Driven Planner to address this challenge. Sparse Gaussian predictions are introduced to improve both the computational efficiency and accuracy of opponent predictions. Furthermore, the proposed approach employs a bi-level quadratic programming framework to generate an overtaking trajectory leveraging the opponent predictions. The first level uses polynomial fitting to generate a rough trajectory, from which reference states and control inputs are derived for the second level. The second level formulates a model predictive control optimization problem in the Frenet frame, generating a trajectory that satisfies both kinematic feasibility and safety. Experimental results on the F1TENTH platform show that our method outperforms the State-of-the-Art, achieving an 8.93% higher overtaking success rate, allowing the maximum opponent speed, ensuring a smoother ego trajectory, and reducing 74.04% computational time compared to the Predictive Spliner method.

| **[On Delta-Homology Analogy: Memory as Structured Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04203v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the \emph{delta-homology analogy}, which formalizes memory as a set of sparse, topologically irreducible attractors. A \emph{Dirac delta-like memory trace} \( \delta_\gamma \) is identified with a nontrivial homology generator \( [\gamma] \in H_1(\mathcal{Z}) \) on a latent manifold of cognitive states. Such traces are sharply localized along reproducible topological cycles and are only activated when inference trajectories complete a full cycle. They encode minimal, path-dependent memory units that cannot be synthesized from local features alone. Based on the analogy, we propose a topological framework for memory and inference grounded in the structure of spike-timing dynamics and persistent homology. Starting from the observation that polychronous neural groups (PNGs) encode reproducible, time-locked spike sequences shaped by axonal delays and synaptic plasticity, we construct \emph{spatiotemporal complexes} whose temporally consistent transitions define chain complexes over which robust activation cycles emerge. These activation loops are abstracted into \emph{cell posets}, enabling a compact and causally ordered representation of neural activity with overlapping and compositional memory traces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-Impulse Trajectory Design in Two-Body Systems With Riemannian Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11612v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a new method for generating impulsive trajectories in restricted two-body systems by leveraging Riemannian geometry. The proposed method transforms the standard trajectory optimization problem into a purely geometric one that involves computing a set of geodesics for a suitable Riemannian metric. This transformation is achieved by defining a metric, specifically the Jacobi metric, that embeds the dynamics directly into the metric, so any geodesic of the metric is also a dynamically feasible trajectory. The method finds the fuel-optimal transfer trajectory by sampling candidate energy ($\Delta V$) changes for different points on the current and desired orbit, and efficiently computing and evaluating each candidate geodesic, which are equivalent to candidate orbit transfer trajectories via the Jacobi metric. The method bypasses the known issues of optimization-based methods, e.g., sensitivity to the initial guess, and can be applied to more complex two-body systems. The approach is demonstrated on the minimum-$\Delta V$ two-impulse phase-free orbit transfer problem, first on a Keplerian system and second on a system with a modeled $J_2$ perturbation. The proposed method is shown to meet or exceed the state-of-the-art methods in the minimum-$\Delta V$ problem in the Keplerian system. The generality and versatility of the approach is demonstrated by seamlessly including the $J_2$ perturbation, a case that many existing methods cannot handle. Numerical simulations and performance comparisons showcase the effectiveness of the approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajSV: A Trajectory-based Model for Sports Video Representations and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11569v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sports analytics has received significant attention from both academia and industry in recent years. Despite the growing interest and efforts in this field, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2) lack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for sufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a trajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies. TrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation Network (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data preprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports broadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to learn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet learns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual features with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive loss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an unsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video datasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e., soccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e., sports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results demonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video retrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in action spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action categories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning. Additionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications based on TrajSV.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by TCSVT</p></details> |
| **[Relative Position Matters: Trajectory Prediction and Planning with Polar Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11492v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction and planning in autonomous driving are highly challenging due to the complexity of predicting surrounding agents' movements and planning the ego agent's actions in dynamic environments. Existing methods encode map and agent positions and decode future trajectories in Cartesian coordinates. However, modeling the relationships between the ego vehicle and surrounding traffic elements in Cartesian space can be suboptimal, as it does not naturally capture the varying influence of different elements based on their relative distances and directions. To address this limitation, we adopt the Polar coordinate system, where positions are represented by radius and angle. This representation provides a more intuitive and effective way to model spatial changes and relative relationships, especially in terms of distance and directional influence. Based on this insight, we propose Polaris, a novel method that operates entirely in Polar coordinates, distinguishing itself from conventional Cartesian-based approaches. By leveraging the Polar representation, this method explicitly models distance and direction variations and captures relative relationships through dedicated encoding and refinement modules, enabling more structured and spatially aware trajectory prediction and planning. Extensive experiments on the challenging prediction (Argoverse 2) and planning benchmarks (nuPlan) demonstrate that Polaris achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[KDPE: A Kernel Density Estimation Strategy for Diffusion Policy Trajectory Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10511v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning robot policies that capture multimodality in the training data has been a long-standing open challenge for behavior cloning. Recent approaches tackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with generative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on a diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories. While achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that may lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First, the stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of generated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach, it can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training. Recent work focuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy either with large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms. Instead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that filters out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while keeping a low test-time computational overhead. For Kernel Density Estimation, we propose a manifold-aware kernel to model a probability density function for actions composed of end-effector Cartesian position, orientation, and gripper state. KDPE overall achieves better performance than Diffusion Policy on simulated single-arm tasks and real robot experiments.

This phenomena diminishes utility in production applications that repeatedly rely on common prompt templates or applications that frequently rely on LLMs for specific tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, language translation). Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that LLMs still tend to refuse responses to harmful instructions when those instructions are reframed to appear as benign tasks. Our mechanistic analysis reveal that LLMs follow distinct "constellation" patterns in embedding space as representations traverse layers, with each task maintaining consistent trajectories that shift predictably between refusal and non-refusal cases. We introduce SafeConstellations, an inference-time trajectory-shifting approach that tracks task-specific trajectory patterns and guides representations toward non-refusal pathways. By selectively guiding model behavior only on tasks prone to over-refusal, and by preserving general model behavior, our method reduces over-refusal rates by up to 73% with minimal impact on utility-offering a principled approach to mitigating over-refusals.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, existing fault-tolerant control methods exhibit significant oscillations during docking and separation, impacting system stability. To address this issue, we propose a novel fault-tolerant control reallocation method that adapts to an arbitrary number of modular robots and their assembly formations. The algorithm redistributes the expected collective force and torque required for MARS to individual units according to their moment arm relative to the center of MARS mass. Furthermore, we propose an agile trajectory planning method for MARS of arbitrary configurations, which is collision-avoiding and dynamically feasible. Our work represents the first comprehensive approach to enable fault-tolerant and collision avoidance flight for MARS. We validate our method through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved fault tolerance, enhanced trajectory tracking accuracy, and greater robustness in cluttered environments.

The main aim is to reconstruct GPS trajectories with high accuracy, independent of input data quality. Building upon the original algorithm, developed exclusively for aligning GPS signals to road networks, we extend its capabilities by integrating trajectory imputation. Our improvements also include the implementation of a distance-bounded interactive voting strategy to reduce computational complexity, as well as modifications to address missing data in the road network. Furthermore, we incorporate a custom-built asset derived from OpenStreetMap, enabling this approach to be smoothly applied in any geographic region covered by OpenStreetMap's road network. These advancements preserve the core strengths of the original algorithm while significantly extending its applicability to diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, a key challenge in such approaches lies in selecting an appropriate masking strategy. Previous studies have explored predefined masking techniques, including random and tube-based masking, as well as approaches that leverage key motion priors, optical flow and semantic cues from externally pre-trained models. In this work, we introduce a novel and generalizable Trajectory-Aware Adaptive Token Sampler (TATS), which models the motion dynamics of tokens and can be seamlessly integrated into the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework to select motion-centric tokens in videos. Additionally, we propose a unified training strategy that enables joint optimization of both MAE and TATS from scratch using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We show that our model allows for aggressive masking without compromising performance on the downstream task of action recognition while also ensuring that the pre-training remains memory efficient. Extensive experiments of the proposed approach across four benchmarks, including Something-Something v2, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, generalization, and efficiency of our work compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICCVW 2025 - Long Multi-Scene Video Foundations Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Methods for Accurate Sparse Trajectory Recovery and Map Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10460v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world trajectories are often sparse with low-sampling rates (i.e., long intervals between consecutive GPS points) and misaligned with road networks, yet many applications demand high-quality data for optimal performance. To improve data quality with sparse trajectories as input, we systematically study two related research problems: trajectory recovery on road network, which aims to infer missing points to recover high-sampling trajectories, and map matching, which aims to map GPS points to road segments to determine underlying routes. In this paper, we present efficient methods TRMMA and MMA for accurate trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, where MMA serves as the first step of TRMMA. In MMA, we carefully formulate a classification task to map a GPS point from sparse trajectories to a road segment over a small candidate segment set, rather than the entire road network. We develop techniques in MMA to generate effective embeddings that capture the patterns of GPS data, directional information, and road segments, to accurately align sparse trajectories to routes. For trajectory recovery, TRMMA focuses on the segments in the route returned by MMA to infer missing points with position ratios on road segments, producing high-sampling trajectories efficiently by avoiding evaluation of all road segments. Specifically, in TRMMA, we design a dual-transformer encoding process to cohesively capture latent patterns in trajectories and routes, and an effective decoding technique to sequentially predict the position ratios and road segments of missing points. We conduct extensive experiments to compare TRMMA and MMA with numerous existing methods for trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, on 4 large real-world datasets. TRMMA and MMA consistently achieve the best result quality, often by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by 2025 IEEE 41st International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)</p></details> |

Among existing methods, the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) has gained popularity due to its strong convergence guarantees and suitability for decentralized computation. However, ADMM often suffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In this work, we show that distributed ADMM iterations can be naturally represented within the message-passing framework of graph neural networks (GNNs). Building on this connection, we propose to learn adaptive step sizes and communication weights by a graph neural network that predicts the hyperparameters based on the iterates. By unrolling ADMM for a fixed number of iterations, we train the network parameters end-to-end to minimize the final iterates error for a given problem class, while preserving the algorithm's convergence properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our learned variant consistently improves convergence speed and solution quality compared to standard ADMM.

MatterVial expands the feature space by integrating latent representations from a diverse suite of pretrained graph neural network (GNN) models including: structure-based (MEGNet), composition-based (ROOST), and equivariant (ORB) graph networks, with computationally efficient, GNN-approximated descriptors and novel features from symbolic regression. Our approach combines the chemical transparency of traditional feature-based models with the predictive power of deep learning architectures. When augmenting the feature-based model MODNet on Matbench tasks, this method yields significant error reductions and elevates its performance to be competitive with, and in several cases superior to, state-of-the-art end-to-end GNNs, with accuracy increases exceeding 40% for multiple tasks. An integrated interpretability module, employing surrogate models and symbolic regression, decodes the latent GNN-derived descriptors into explicit, physically meaningful formulas. This unified framework advances materials informatics by providing a high-performance, transparent tool that aligns with the principles of explainable AI, paving the way for more targeted and autonomous materials discovery.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based approaches mitigate the computational loads, yet the communication overhead remains a challenge.

Evaluation on benchmark graph datasets demonstrates RapidGNN's effectiveness across different scales and topologies. RapidGNN improves end-to-end training throughput by 2.46x to 3.00x on average over baseline methods across the benchmark datasets, while cutting remote feature fetches by over 9.70x to 15.39x. RapidGNN further demonstrates near-linear scalability with an increasing number of computing units efficiently.

| **[Hybrid Matrix Factorization Based Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05115v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, methods that combine contrastive learning with graph neural networks have emerged to address the challenges of recommendation systems, demonstrating powerful performance and playing a significant role in this domain. Contrastive learning primarily tackles the issue of data sparsity by employing data augmentation strategies, effectively alleviating this problem and showing promising results. Although existing research has achieved favorable outcomes, most current graph contrastive learning methods are based on two types of data augmentation strategies: the first involves perturbing the graph structure, such as by randomly adding or removing edges; and the second applies clustering techniques. We believe that the interactive information obtained through these two strategies does not fully capture the user-item interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel method called HMFGCL (Hybrid Matrix Factorization Based Graph Contrastive Learning), which integrates two distinct matrix factorization techniques-low-rank matrix factorization (MF) and singular value decomposition (SVD)-to complementarily acquire global collaborative information, thereby constructing enhanced views. Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing baselines, particularly on small-scale datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Unlearning: Efficient Node Removal in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04785v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With increasing concerns about privacy attacks and potential sensitive information leakage, researchers have actively explored methods to efficiently remove sensitive training data and reduce privacy risks in graph neural network (GNN) models. Node unlearning has emerged as a promising technique for protecting the privacy of sensitive nodes by efficiently removing specific training node information from GNN models. However, existing node unlearning methods either impose restrictions on the GNN structure or do not effectively utilize the graph topology for node unlearning. Some methods even compromise the graph's topology, making it challenging to achieve a satisfactory performance-complexity trade-off. To address these issues and achieve efficient unlearning for training node removal in GNNs, we propose three novel node unlearning methods: Class-based Label Replacement, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability, and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering. Among these methods, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering effectively leverage the topological features of the graph, resulting in more effective node unlearning. To validate the superiority of our proposed methods in node unlearning, we conducted experiments on three benchmark datasets. The evaluation criteria included model utility, unlearning utility, and unlearning efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed methods and illustrate their superiority compared to state-of-the-art node unlearning methods.

The findings contribute to enhancing the privacy and security of GNN models and provide valuable insights into the field of node unlearning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inferring the Graph Structure of Images for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04677v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image datasets such as MNIST are a key benchmark for testing Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures. The images are traditionally represented as a grid graph with each node representing a pixel and edges connecting neighboring pixels (vertically and horizontally). The graph signal is the values (intensities) of each pixel in the image. The graphs are commonly used as input to graph neural networks (e.g., Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (Graph CNNs) [1, 2], Graph Attention Networks (GAT) [3], GatedGCN [4]) to classify the images. In this work, we improve the accuracy of downstream graph neural network tasks by finding alternative graphs to the grid graph and superpixel methods to represent the dataset images, following the approach in [5, 6]. We find row correlation, column correlation, and product graphs for each image in MNIST and Fashion-MNIST using correlations between the pixel values building on the method in [5, 6]. Experiments show that using these different graph representations and features as input into downstream GNN models improves the accuracy over using the traditional grid graph and superpixel methods in the literature.</p></details> |  |

While classical approaches such as Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) remain widely used, they often fail to capture the spatial dependencies inherent in energy networks. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework to incorporate this structure by directly leveraging graph topologies. In this work, we evaluate a broad set of GNN architectures -- including GCN, GraphSAGE, ChebConv, TAG, APPNP, TransformerConv, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT and GATv2) -- on two real-world electricity consumption datasets from France and the UK. Our results show that simpler models such as GCN, SAGE, or APPNP often outperform more complex alternatives in low-data regimes, while GAT ranks among the strongest architectures in our benchmarks, combining high accuracy with valuable interpretability. We perform a temporal analysis of attention weights, revealing evolving patterns of regional interaction linked to seasonal and meteorological variability. These results highlight that, although attention is not universally superior, it provides valuable explanatory power when spatial dependencies are prominent. Additionally, we demonstrate that ensemble-based expert aggregation strategies, particularly bottom-up combinations, significantly improve robustness and yield state-of-the-art performance across both datasets. These findings highlight the dual promise of GNNs for accurate and interpretable forecasting, and suggest that architectural simplicity coupled with ensemble methods can provide a practical path forward for transparent energy analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, ECML PKDD 2025 Workshop paper</p></details> |

We introduce Topotein, a comprehensive framework that applies topological deep learning to PRL through the novel Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) and Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet). Our PCC represents proteins at multiple hierarchical levels -- from residues to secondary structures to complete proteins -- while preserving geometric information at each level. TCPNet employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchical structures, enabling more effective capture of multi-scale structural patterns. Through extensive experiments on four PRL tasks, TCPNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks. Our approach demonstrates particular strength in tasks such as fold classification which require understanding of secondary structure arrangements, validating the importance of hierarchical topological features for protein analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[EZhouNet:A framework based on graph neural network and anchor interval for the respiratory sound event detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01153v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auscultation is a key method for early diagnosis of respiratory and pulmonary diseases, relying on skilled healthcare professionals. However, the process is often subjective, with variability between experts. As a result, numerous deep learning-based automatic classification methods have emerged, most of which focus on respiratory sound classification. In contrast, research on respiratory sound event detection remains limited. Existing sound event detection methods typically rely on frame-level predictions followed by post-processing to generate event-level outputs, making interval boundaries challenging to learn directly. Furthermore, many approaches can only handle fixed-length audio, limiting their applicability to variable-length respiratory sounds. Additionally, the impact of respiratory sound location information on detection performance has not been extensively explored. To address these issues, we propose a graph neural network-based framework with anchor intervals, capable of handling variable-length audio and providing more precise temporal localization for abnormal respiratory sound events. Our method improves both the flexibility and applicability of respiratory sound detection. Experiments on the SPRSound 2024 and HF Lung V1 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and incorporating respiratory position information enhances the discrimination between abnormal sounds.

Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems. However, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in static free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving primitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically moving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed from the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body interactions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph nodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations with the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. This approach enables the network to model complex interactions between liquid particles and intricate surface geometries. Our model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic settings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments. Despite being trained on a single-object manipulation task of pouring, our model generalizes effectively to environments with unseen objects and novel manipulation tasks such as stirring and scooping. Finally, we show that the learned dynamics can be leveraged to solve control and manipulation tasks using gradient-based optimization methods.</p></details> |  |

When treating sepsis, it is challenging to determine the correct amount of intravenous fluids and vasopressors for a given patient. While automated reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have been used to support these decisions with promising results, previous studies have relied on relational data. Given the complexity of modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more natural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the well-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time. Subsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and GATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of decoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are trained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that predict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy learning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation confirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the complexity of representation learning in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>18th ...</summary><p>18th European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning (EWRL 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Transformer-Guided Content-Adaptive Graph Learning for Hyperspectral Unmixing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03376v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) targets to decompose each mixed pixel in remote sensing images into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances. Despite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods fail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency, making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary details. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph unmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a transformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work, T-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph structure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/T-CAGU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Select MCP Algorithms: From Traditional ML to Dual-Channel GAT-MLP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08005v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensive experiments and prior studies show that no single maximum clique algorithm consistently performs best across all instances, highlighting the importance of selecting suitable algorithms based on instance features. Through an extensive analysis of relevant studies, it is found that there is a lack of research work concerning algorithm selection oriented toward the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP). In this work, we propose a learning-based framework that integrates both traditional machine learning and graph neural networks to address this gap. We construct a labeled dataset by running four exact MCP algorithms on a diverse collection of graph instances, accompanied by structural and global statistical features extracted from each graph. We first evaluate four conventional classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), across multiple dataset variants. Experimental results show that RF consistently shows strong performance across metrics and dataset variants, making it a reliable baseline. In addition, feature importance analysis indicates that connectivity and topological structure are strong predictors of algorithm performance. Building on these findings, we develop a dual-channel model named GAT-MLP, which combines a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for local structural encoding with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for global feature modeling. The GAT-MLP model shows strong and consistent performance across all metrics. Our results highlight the effectiveness of dual-channel architectures and the promise of graph neural networks in combinatorial algorithm selection.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

However, as of yet, the analysis of social networks using the time series of people's mobile connectivity data has not been extensively investigated. In the present study, we investigate four snapshot - based temporal GNNs in predicting the phone call and SMS activity between users of a mobile communication network. In addition, we develop a simple non - GNN baseline model using recently proposed EdgeBank method. Our analysis shows that the ROLAND temporal GNN outperforms the baseline model in most cases, whereas the other three GNNs perform on average worse than the baseline. The results show that GNN based approaches hold promise in the analysis of temporal social networks through mobile connectivity data. However, due to the relatively small performance margin between ROLAND and the baseline model, further research is required on specialized GNN architectures for temporal social network analysis.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Can Large Language Models Act as Ensembler for Multi-GNNs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16822v5)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning from graph-structured data. However, GNNs lack the inherent semantic understanding capability of rich textual node attributes, limiting their effectiveness in applications. On the other hand, we empirically observe that for existing GNN models, no one can consistently outperforms others across diverse datasets. In this paper, we study whether LLMs can act as an ensembler for multi-GNNs and propose the LensGNN model. The model first aligns multiple GNNs, mapping the representations of different GNNs into the same space. Then, through LoRA fine-tuning, it aligns the space between the GNN and the LLM, injecting graph tokens and textual information into LLMs. This allows LensGNN to ensemble multiple GNNs and take advantage of the strengths of LLM, leading to a deeper understanding of both textual semantic information and graph structural information. The experimental results show that LensGNN outperforms existing models. This research advances text-attributed graph ensemble learning by providing a robust and superior solution for integrating semantic and structural information.

However, the reliability of XAI is challenged by the Rashomon effect, where multiple, equally accurate models can offer divergent explanations for the same prediction. This paper provides the first empirical quantification of this effect for the task of action prediction in real-world driving scenes. Using Qualitative Explainable Graphs (QXGs) as a symbolic scene representation, we train Rashomon sets of two distinct model classes: interpretable, pair-based gradient boosting models and complex, graph-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Using feature attribution methods, we measure the agreement of explanations both within and between these classes. Our results reveal significant explanation disagreement. Our findings suggest that explanation ambiguity is an inherent property of the problem, not just a modeling artifact.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 Fall Symposium: AI Trustworthiness and Risk Assessment for Challenged Contexts (ATRACC)</p></details> |

We introduce NCMemo (Node Classification Memorization), the first framework to quantify label memorization in semi-supervised node classification. We first establish an inverse relationship between memorization and graph homophily, i.e., the property that connected nodes share similar labels/features. We find that lower homophily significantly increases memorization, indicating that GNNs rely on memorization to learn less homophilic graphs. Secondly, we analyze GNN training dynamics. We find that the increased memorization in low homophily graphs is tightly coupled to the GNNs' implicit bias on using graph structure during learning. In low homophily regimes, this structure is less informative, hence inducing memorization of the node labels to minimize training loss. Finally, we show that nodes with higher label inconsistency in their feature-space neighborhood are significantly more prone to memorization. Building on our insights into the link between graph homophily and memorization, we investigate graph rewiring as a means to mitigate memorization. Our results demonstrate that this approach effectively reduces memorization without compromising model performance. Moreover, we show that it lowers the privacy risk for previously memorized data points in practice. Thus, our work not only advances understanding of GNN learning but also supports more privacy-preserving GNN deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version3, updated affiliation</p></details> |

We propose a cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving blood-flow fields using a graph neural network on the AnXplore dataset. Our experiments show that the inclusion of these features yields strong gains in accuracy, F1-score and segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines, and reduces simulation error by 15\%. These results illustrate the broader potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative models to specialized medical tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, interpreting GNN decisions remains a significant challenge, leading to the adoption of saliency maps for identifying salient subgraphs composed of influential nodes and edges. Despite their utility, the reliability of GNN saliency maps has been questioned, particularly in terms of their robustness to input noise. In this study, we propose a statistical testing framework to rigorously evaluate the significance of saliency maps. Our main contribution lies in addressing the inflation of the Type I error rate caused by double-dipping of data, leveraging the framework of Selective Inference. Our method provides statistically valid $p$-values while controlling the Type I error rate, ensuring that identified salient subgraphs contain meaningful information rather than random artifacts. The method is applicable to a variety of saliency methods with piecewise linearity (e.g., Class Activation Mapping). We validate our method on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its capability in assessing the reliability of GNN interpretations.</p></details> |  |

Our method combines structural learning from graph neural networks (GNNs) with a learned distributed update mechanism that, given an edge addition or deletion event, modifies nodes' internal memories and infers their MaxIS membership in a single, parallel step. We parameterize our model by the update mechanism's radius and investigate the resulting performance-runtime tradeoffs for various dynamic graph topologies. We evaluate our model against a mixed integer programming solver and the state-of-the-art learning-based methods for MaxIS on static graphs (ICML 2020; NeurIPS 2020, 2023). Across synthetic and empirical dynamic graphs of 50-1,000 nodes, our model achieves competitive approximation ratios with excellent scalability; on large graphs, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art learning methods in solution quality, runtime, and memory usage. When generalizing to graphs of 10,000 nodes (100x larger than the ones used for training), our model produces MaxIS solutions 1.05-1.18x larger than any other learning method, even while maintaining competitive runtimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, 3 algorithms</p></details> |

However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc descriptor-based residual-based learning (PDRL). PDRL models the discrepancy between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of PDRL and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their effectiveness and limitations.</p></details> |  |

While algorithms have been proposed to improve the accuracy of training graph neural networks, such as node classification on federated graphs, the system performance is often overlooked, despite it is crucial for real-world deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce FedGraph, a research library designed for practical distributed training and comprehensive benchmarking of FGL algorithms. FedGraph supports a range of state-of-the-art graph learning methods and includes a monitoring class that evaluates system performance, with a particular focus on communication and computation costs during training. Unlike existing federated learning platforms, FedGraph natively integrates homomorphic encryption to enhance privacy preservation and supports scalable deployment across multiple physical machines with system-level performance evaluation to guide the system design of future algorithms. To enhance efficiency and privacy, we propose a low-rank communication scheme for algorithms like FedGCN that require pre-training communication, accelerating both the pre-training and training phases. Extensive experiments benchmark FGL algorithms on three major graph learning tasks and demonstrate FedGraph as the first efficient FGL framework to support encrypted low-rank communication and scale to graphs with 100 million nodes.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/FedGraph/fedgraph</p></details> |

Traditional control systems, which are human and optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving context, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control strategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning framework for real-time, scalable grid management. The proposed architecture consists of a network of distributed low-level agents acting on individual power lines and coordinated by a high-level manager agent. A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information within the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and enhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and potential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized approaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global observations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level agent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment constructed through the GNN. Experiments on the Grid2Op simulation environment show the effectiveness of the approach, which consistently outperforms the standard baseline commonly adopted in the field. Additionally, the proposed model proves to be much more computationally efficient than the simulation-based Expert method.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) often struggle to capture global and regional graph structure due to over-smoothing risk as network depth increases. Because the low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix encode global information, pre-training GNNs to predict these eigenvectors encourages the network to naturally learn large-scale structural patterns over each graph. Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform baseline models on a variety of graph structure-based tasks. While most existing pre-training methods focus on domain-specific tasks like node or edge feature reconstruction, our self-supervised pre-training framework is structure-based and highly flexible. Eigenvector-learning can be applied to all graph-based datasets, and can be used with synthetic features when task-specific data is sparse.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, systematic biases often persist, making statistical post-processing essential. Traditional parametric post-processing techniques and machine learning-based methods can produce calibrated predictive distributions at specific locations and lead times, yet often struggle to capture dependencies across forecast dimensions. To address this, multivariate post-processing methods-such as ensemble copula coupling and the Schaake shuffle-are widely applied in a second step to restore realistic inter-variable or spatio-temporal dependencies. The aim of this study is the multivariate post-processing of ensemble forecasts using a graph neural network (dualGNN) trained with a composite loss function that combines the energy score (ES) and the variogram score (VS). The method is evaluated on two datasets: WRF-based solar irradiance forecasts over northern Chile and ECMWF visibility forecasts for Central Europe. The dualGNN consistently outperforms all empirical copula-based post-processed forecasts and shows significant improvements compared to graph neural networks trained solely on either the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) or the ES, according to the evaluated multivariate verification metrics. Furthermore, for the WRF forecasts, the rank-order structure of the dualGNN forecasts captures valuable dependency information, enabling a more effective restoration of spatial relationships than either the raw numerical weather prediction ensemble or historical observational rank structures. By contrast, for the visibility forecasts, the GNNs trained on CRPS, ES, or the ES-VS combination outperform the calibrated reference.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 16 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Due to the elusive syntax and complicated semantics in programs, most existing studies use techniques based on abstract syntax tree (AST) and graph neural networks (GNN) to create code representations for code classification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information of the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect the high-order data correlations that already exist between nodes of the same field or called attribute in the AST, which may result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while a general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous and undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural information such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes and parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) to represent AST and a heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) to process the graph for code classification. Our method improves code understanding and can represent high-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess our heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of Python and Java programs. Our method outperforms previous AST-based and GNN-based methods, which demonstrates the capability of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 35th International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE 2023) as a regular paper</p></details> |

Traditional data-driven approaches, such as convolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological information about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate information exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning hydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction models collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training explodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing methods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying GNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences, thus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for accurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every land and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow directions and inter-catchment relationships. We propose HydroGAT, a spatiotemporal network that adaptively learns local temporal importance and the most influential upstream locations. Evaluated in two Midwestern US basins and across five baseline architectures, our model achieves higher NSE (up to 0.97), improved KGE (up to 0.96), and low bias (PBIAS within $\pm$5%) in hourly discharge prediction, while offering interpretable attention maps that reveal sparse, structured intercatchment influences.

| **[Automating Traffic Monitoring with SHM Sensor Networks via Vision-Supervised Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19023v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bridges, as critical components of civil infrastructure, are increasingly affected by deterioration, making reliable traffic monitoring essential for assessing their remaining service life. Among operational loads, traffic load plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation. To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.</p></details> |  |

Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas \textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving \textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.</p></details> |  |
| **[Second-Order Tensorial Partial Differential Equations on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02015v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Processing data that lies on multiple interacting (product) graphs is increasingly important in practical applications, yet existing methods are mostly restricted to discrete graph filtering. Tensorial partial differential equations on graphs (TPDEGs) offer a principled framework for modeling such multidomain data in a continuous setting. However, current continuous approaches are limited to first-order derivatives, which tend to dampen high-frequency signals and slow down information propagation. This makes these TPDEGs-based approaches less effective for capturing complex, multi-scale, and heterophilic structures. In this paper, we introduce second-order TPDEGs (So-TPDEGs) and propose the first theoretically grounded framework for second-order continuous product graph neural networks. Our approach leverages the separability of cosine kernels in Cartesian product graphs to implement efficient spectral decomposition, while naturally preserving high-frequency information. We provide rigorous theoretical analyses of stability under graph perturbations and over-smoothing behavior regarding spectral properties. Our theoretical results establish a robust foundation for advancing continuous graph learning across multiple practical domains.</p></details> | 12 pages, 1 figure |

Process-based models provide physical realism but can suffer from structural rigidity, high computational costs, and complex calibration, while machine learning (ML) methods are efficient and flexible yet often lack interpretability and transferability. We propose a unified three-phase framework that integrates process-based models with ML and progressively embeds them into artificial intelligence (AI) through knowledge distillation. Phase I, behavioral distillation, enhances process models via surrogate learning and model simplification to capture key dynamics at lower computational cost. Phase II, structural distillation, reformulates process equations as modular components within a graph neural network (GNN), enabling multiscale representation and seamless integration with ML models. Phase III, cognitive distillation, embeds expert reasoning and adaptive decision-making into intelligent modeling agents using the Eyes-Brain-Hands-Mouth architecture. Demonstrations for the Samish watershed highlight the framework's applicability to ecohydrological modeling, showing that it can reproduce process-based model outputs, improve predictive accuracy, and support scenario-based decision-making. The framework offers a scalable and transferable pathway toward next-generation intelligent ecohydrological modeling systems, with the potential extension to other process-based domains.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

Previous research has looked into this problem from the perspective of i.i.d. data. Here, we develop a framework, GraCE-VAE, for non-i.i.d. settings, in which structured context in the form of network data is available. GraCE-VAE integrates discrepancy-based variational autoencoders with graph neural networks to jointly recover the true latent causal graph and intervention effects. We show that the theoretical results of identifiability from i.i.d. data hold in our setup. We also empirically evaluate GraCE-VAE against state-of-the-art baselines on three genetic perturbation datasets to demonstrate the impact of leveraging structured context for causal disentanglement.</p></details> |  |

Eye Tracking-Based Modeling of Situational Awareness in Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05025v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g., bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved 83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.</p></details> |  |

However, the high dimensionality and technical noise inherent in scRNA-seq data pose significant analytical challenges. While current embedding methods focus primarily on gene expression levels, they often overlook crucial gene-gene interactions that govern cellular identity and function. To address this limitation, we present a novel embedding approach that integrates both gene expression profiles and data-driven gene-gene interactions. Our method first constructs a Cell-Leaf Graph (CLG) using random forest models to capture regulatory relationships between genes, while simultaneously building a K-Nearest Neighbor Graph (KNNG) to represent expression similarities between cells. These graphs are then combined into an Enriched Cell-Leaf Graph (ECLG), which serves as input for a graph neural network to compute cell embeddings. By incorporating both expression levels and gene-gene interactions, our approach provides a more comprehensive representation of cellular states. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets demonstrates that our method enhances the detection of rare cell populations and improves downstream analyses such as visualization, clustering, and trajectory inference. This integrated approach represents a significant advance in single-cell data analysis, offering a more complete framework for understanding cellular diversity and dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 9 figures, article</p></details> |

Automated Essay Scoring (AES) offers a promising alternative, but current approaches face limitations. Recent studies have incorporated Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into AES using static word embeddings that fail to capture contextual meaning, especially for polysemous words. Additionally, many methods rely on holistic scoring, overlooking specific writing aspects such as grammar, vocabulary, and cohesion. To address these challenges, this study proposes TransGAT, a novel approach that integrates fine-tuned Transformer models with GNNs for analytic scoring. TransGAT combines the contextual understanding of Transformers with the relational modeling strength of Graph Attention Networks (GAT). It performs two-stream predictions by pairing each fine-tuned Transformer (BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTaV3) with a separate GAT. In each pair, the first stream generates essay-level predictions, while the second applies GAT to Transformer token embeddings, with edges constructed from syntactic dependencies. The model then fuses predictions from both streams to produce the final analytic score. Experiments on the ELLIPSE dataset show that TransGAT outperforms baseline models, achieving an average Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.854 across all analytic scoring dimensions. These findings highlight the potential of TransGAT to advance AES systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Contrastive Learning versus Untrained Baselines: The Role of Dataset Size](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01541v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for self-supervised learning on graphs, with strong performance reported on standardized datasets and growing applications ranging from genomics to drug discovery. We ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications, as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

A key characteristic of GNNs is their use of a fixed number of message-passing steps for all nodes in the graph, regardless of each node's diverse computational needs and characteristics. Through empirical real-world data analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal number of message-passing layers varies for nodes with different characteristics. This finding is further supported by experiments conducted on synthetic datasets. To address this, we propose Adaptive Depth Message Passing GNN (ADMP-GNN), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts the number of message passing layers for each node, resulting in improved performance. This approach applies to any model that follows the message passing scheme. We evaluate ADMP-GNN on the node classification task and observe performance improvements over baseline GNN models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Exploring Language Models for Explainable Link Forecasting on Temporal Graphs via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00975v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning, requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones. Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs. ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.</p></details> |  |

We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features, directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics. Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.</p></details> |  |

Our method explicitly bridges physical spectral measurements and chemical structural semantics by representing them in a unified Textual Graph format, enabling flexible, interpretable, and generalizable spectral understanding. Raw spectra are first transformed into TAGs, where nodes and edges are enriched with textual attributes describing both spectral properties and chemical context. These are then merged with relevant prior knowledge-including functional groups and molecular graphs-to form a Task Graph that incorporates "Prompt Nodes" supporting LLM-based contextual reasoning. A Graph Neural Network further processes this structure to complete downstream tasks. This unified design enables seamless multi-modal integration and automated feature decoding with minimal manual annotation. Our framework achieves consistently high performance across multiple spectral analysis tasks, including node-level, edge-level, and graph-level classification. It demonstrates robust generalization in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, highlighting its effectiveness in learning from limited data and supporting in-context reasoning. This work establishes a scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM-driven spectral analysis, unifying physical and chemical modalities for scientific applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ne...</summary><p>We need to further modify and supplement the experiment</p></details> |

In recent years, researchers have made significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic, i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty, leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes), thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and (ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5% improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, SIGSPATIAL 2025</p></details> |

To tackle this, methods like coarsening, condensation, and computation trees are used to train on a smaller graph, resulting in faster computation. Nonetheless, prior research has not adequately addressed the computational costs during the inference phase. This paper presents a novel approach to improve the scalability of GNNs by reducing computational burden during the inference phase using graph coarsening. We demonstrate two different methods -- Extra Nodes and Cluster Nodes. Our study extends the application of graph coarsening for graph-level tasks, including graph classification and graph regression. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of our approach. Our results show that the proposed method achieves orders of magnitude improvements in single-node inference time compared to traditional approaches. Furthermore, it significantly reduces memory consumption for node and graph classification and regression tasks, enabling efficient training and inference on low-resource devices where conventional methods are impractical. Notably, these computational advantages are achieved while maintaining competitive performance relative to baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow Matters: Directional and Expressive GNNs for Heterophilic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00772v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often belong to different classes, conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle due to their reliance on local homophilous neighborhoods. Prior studies suggest that modeling edge directionality in such graphs can increase effective homophily and improve classification performance. Simultaneously, recent work on polynomially expressive GNNs shows promise in capturing higher-order interactions among features. In this work, we study the combined effect of edge directionality and expressive message passing on node classification in heterophilic graphs. Specifically, we propose two architectures: (1) a polynomially expressive GAT baseline (Poly), and (2) a direction-aware variant (Dir-Poly) that separately aggregates incoming and outgoing edges. Both models are designed to learn permutation-equivariant high-degree polynomials over input features, while remaining scalable with no added time complexity. Experiments on five benchmark heterophilic datasets show that our Poly model consistently outperforms existing baselines, and that Dir-Poly offers additional gains on graphs with inherent directionality (e.g., Roman Empire), achieving state-of-the-art results. Interestingly, on undirected graphs, introducing artificial directionality does not always help, suggesting that the benefit of directional message passing is context-dependent. Our findings highlight the complementary roles of edge direction and expressive feature modeling in heterophilic graph learning.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches either convert graph structures into verbose textual descriptions, consuming substantial computational resources, or employ complex graph neural networks as tokenizers, which introduce significant training overhead. To bridge this gap, we present NT-LLM, a novel framework with an anchor-based positional encoding scheme for graph representation. Our approach strategically selects reference nodes as anchors and encodes each node's position relative to these anchors, capturing essential topological information without the computational burden of existing methods. Notably, we identify and address a fundamental issue: the inherent misalignment between discrete hop-based distances in graphs and continuous distances in embedding spaces. By implementing a rank-preserving objective for positional encoding pretraining, NT-LLM achieves superior performance across diverse graph tasks ranging from basic structural analysis to complex reasoning scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that this lightweight yet powerful approach effectively enhances LLMs' ability to understand and reason with graph-structured information, offering an efficient solution for graph-based applications of language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

While decomposition-integrated approaches like variational mode graph convolutional network (VMGCN) improve accuracy through signal decomposition, they suffer from computational inefficiency and manual hyperparameter tuning. To address these limitations, we propose the mode adaptive graph network (MAGN) that transforms iterative variational mode decomposition (VMD) into a trainable neural module. Our key innovations include (1) an unfolded VMD (UVMD) module that replaces iterative optimization with a fixed-depth network to reduce the decomposition time (by 250x for the LargeST benchmark), and (2) mode-specific learnable bandwidth constraints ({\alpha}k ) adapt spatial heterogeneity and eliminate manual tuning while preventing spectral overlap. Evaluated on the LargeST benchmark (6,902 sensors, 241M observations), MAGN achieves an 85-95% reduction in the prediction error over VMGCN and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review in IEEE Signal Processing Letter</p></details> |

Our approach is grounded in semantic parsing, a key technique for interpreting question utterances. The main challenges arise from handling implicit entities and relations, as well as complex constraints such as temporal conditions, ordinality, and aggregation within the context of a knowledge graph. To address these issues, our framework integrates both rule-based and neural methods to parse and construct accurate, comprehensive semantic segment sequences. These sequences are then assembled into semantic query graphs, providing precise representations of question utterances. We formulate question semantic parsing as a sequence generation task, employing an encoder-decoder neural network to map natural language questions into semantic segments. Furthermore, to enhance the identification of implicit entities and relations, we incorporate a graph neural network that leverages knowledge graph context to enrich question representations. Experimental evaluations on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of our model in semantic parsing for knowledge graph question answering.</p></details> |  |

These applications place higher demands on model compression and inference speed, necessitating the transfer of knowledge from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to more efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. However, due to their fixed activation functions and fully connected architecture, MLPs face challenges in rapidly capturing the complex neighborhood dependencies learned by GNNs, thereby limiting their performance in edge environments. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative from GNNs to Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) knowledge distillation framework-Self Attention Dynamic Sampling Distillation (SA-DSD). This study improved Fourier KAN (FR-KAN) and replaced MLP with the improved FR-KAN+ as the student model. Through the incorporation of learnable frequency bases and phase-shift mechanisms, along with algorithmic optimization, FR-KAN significantly improves its nonlinear fitting capability while effectively reducing computational complexity. Building on this, a margin-level sampling probability matrix, based on teacher-student prediction consistency, is constructed, and an adaptive weighted loss mechanism is designed to mitigate performance degradation in the student model due to the lack of explicit neighborhood aggregation. Extensive experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SA-DSD achieves performance improvements of 3.05%-3.62% over three GNN teacher models and 15.61% over the FR-KAN+ model. Moreover, when compared with key benchmark models, SA-DSD achieves a 16.96x reduction in parameter count and a 55.75% decrease in inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Curriculum Guided Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00402v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subgraph Federated Learning (FL) aims to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) across distributed private subgraphs, but it suffers from severe data heterogeneity. To mitigate data heterogeneity, weighted model aggregation personalizes each local GNN by assigning larger weights to parameters from clients with similar subgraph characteristics inferred from their current model states. However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid overfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even collapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce their own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available. To this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called Curriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the client side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges for training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first to easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder, client-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased patterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization, the curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic knowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves weighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained structural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that CUFL achieves superior performance compared to relevant baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/Kang-Min-Ku/CUFL.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the CIKM 2025.

| **[Unifying Adversarial Perturbation for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00387v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to adversarial attacks on node features and graph structure. Various methods have implemented adversarial training to augment graph data, aiming to bolster the robustness and generalization of GNNs. These methods typically involve applying perturbations to the node feature, weights, or graph structure and subsequently minimizing the loss by learning more robust graph model parameters under the adversarial perturbations. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial training in enhancing GNNs' robustness and generalization abilities, its application has been largely confined to specific datasets and GNN types. In this paper, we propose a novel method, PerturbEmbedding, that integrates adversarial perturbation and training, enhancing GNNs' resilience to such attacks and improving their generalization ability. PerturbEmbedding performs perturbation operations directly on every hidden embedding of GNNs and provides a unified framework for most existing perturbation strategies/methods. We also offer a unified perspective on the forms of perturbations, namely random and adversarial perturbations. Through experiments on various datasets using different backbone models, we demonstrate that PerturbEmbedding significantly improves both the robustness and generalization abilities of GNNs, outperforming existing methods. The rejection of both random (non-targeted) and adversarial (targeted) perturbations further enhances the backbone model's performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Demon is in Ambiguity: Revisiting Situation Recognition with Single Positive Multi-Label Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21816v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling), and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization). Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning (SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDM 2025</p></details> |
| **[On the Hardness of Learning GNN-based SAT Solvers: The Role of Graph Ricci Curvature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21513v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations. We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.</p></details> | Preprint |

While CP algorithms have evolved beyond traditional classifiers and regressors to sophisticated deep learning models like deep neural networks (DNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and large language models (LLMs), existing CP libraries often lack the model support and scalability for large-scale DL scenarios. This paper introduces TorchCP, a PyTorch-native library designed to integrate state-of-the-art CP algorithms into deep learning techniques, including DNN-based classifier/regressor, GNN, and LLM. Released under the LGPL-3.0 license, TorchCP comprises about 16k lines of code, validated with 100% unit test coverage and detailed documentation. Notably, TorchCP enables CP-specific training algorithms, online prediction, and GPU-accelerated batch processing, achieving up to 90% reduction in inference time on large datasets. With its low-coupling design, comprehensive suite of advanced methods, and full GPU scalability, TorchCP empowers researchers and practitioners to enhance uncertainty quantification across cutting-edge applications.</p></details> |  |

Recently, molecular ML has demonstrated great potential in (i) providing highly accurate predictions for properties of pure components and their mixtures, and (ii) exploring the chemical space for new molecular structures. We review current state-of-the-art molecular ML models and discuss research directions that promise further advancements. This includes ML methods, such as graph neural networks and transformers, which can be further advanced through the incorporation of physicochemical knowledge in a hybrid or physics-informed fashion. Then, we consider leveraging molecular ML at the chemical process scale, which is highly desirable yet rather unexplored. We discuss how molecular ML can be integrated into process design and optimization formulations, promising to accelerate the identification of novel molecules and processes. To this end, it will be essential to create molecule and process design benchmarks and practically validate proposed candidates, possibly in collaboration with the chemical industry.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Mixture of Experts Gating Network for Enhanced Surrogate Modeling in External Aerodynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21249v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy, assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2 prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.</p></details> |  |

The training dataset was constructed through an automated framework that integrated geometry generation, meshing, and flow-field solutions in ANSYS Fluent. The pin-fin geometry was parameterized using piecewise cubic splines, producing 1,000 diverse configurations through Latin Hypercube Sampling. Each simulation was converted into a graph structure, where nodes carried a feature vector containing spatial coordinates, a normalized streamwise position, one-hot boundary indicators, and a signed distance to the nearest boundary such as wall. This graph structure served as input to the newly developed Graph Neural Network, which was trained to predict temperature, velocity magnitude, and pressure at each node using data from ANSYS. The network predicted fields with outstanding accuracy, capturing boundary layers, recirculation, and the stagnation region upstream of the pin-fins while reducing wall time by 2-3 orders of magnitude. In conclusion, the novel graph neural network offered a fast and reliable surrogate for simulations in complex flow configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Based Feature Augmentation for Predictive Tasks on Relational Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20986v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data has become a foundational asset driving innovation across domains such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In these areas, predictive modeling over relational tables is commonly employed, with increasing emphasis on reducing manual effort through automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques. This raises an interesting question: can feature augmentation itself be automated and identify and utilize task-related relational signals? To address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end automated feature augmentation framework, ReCoGNN, which enhances initial datasets using features extracted from multiple relational tables to support predictive tasks. ReCoGNN first captures semantic dependencies within each table by modeling intra-table attribute relationships, enabling it to partition tables into structured, semantically coherent segments. It then constructs a heterogeneous weighted graph that represents inter-row relationships across all segments. Finally, ReCoGNN leverages message-passing graph neural networks to propagate information through the graph, guiding feature selection and augmenting the original dataset. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-life and synthetic datasets demonstrate that ReCoGNN consistently outperforms existing methods on both classification and regression tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Based Concurrency Bug Detection and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20911v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concurrency bugs, caused by improper synchronization of shared resources in multi-threaded or distributed systems, are notoriously hard to detect and thus compromise software reliability and security. The existing deep learning methods face three main limitations. First, there is an absence of large and dedicated datasets of diverse concurrency bugs for them. Second, they lack sufficient representation of concurrency semantics. Third, binary classification results fail to provide finer-grained debug information such as precise bug lines. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for effective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a dedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation. We then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that concisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics. To further facilitate debugging, we employ SubgraphX, a GNN-based interpretability method, which explores the graphs to precisely localize concurrency bugs, mapping them to specific lines of source code. On average, our method demonstrates an improvement of 10\% in accuracy and precision and 26\% in recall compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse evaluation settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[ADAGE: Active Defenses Against GNN Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00065v3)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve high performance in various real-world applications, such as drug discovery, traffic states prediction, and recommendation systems. The fact that building powerful GNNs requires a large amount of training data, powerful computing resources, and human expertise turns the models into lucrative targets for model stealing attacks. Prior work has revealed that the threat vector of stealing attacks against GNNs is large and diverse, as an attacker can leverage various heterogeneous signals ranging from node labels to high-dimensional node embeddings to create a local copy of the target GNN at a fraction of the original training costs. This diversity in the threat vector renders the design of effective and general defenses challenging and existing defenses usually focus on one particular stealing setup. Additionally, they solely provide means to identify stolen model copies rather than preventing the attack. To close this gap, we propose the first and general Active Defense Against GNN Extraction (ADAGE). ADAGE builds on the observation that stealing a model's full functionality requires highly diverse queries to leak its behavior across the input space. Our defense monitors this query diversity and progressively perturbs outputs as the accumulated leakage grows. In contrast to prior work, ADAGE can prevent stealing across all common attack setups. Our extensive experimental evaluation using six benchmark datasets, four GNN models, and three types of adaptive attackers shows that ADAGE penalizes attackers to the degree of rendering stealing impossible, whilst preserving predictive performance on downstream tasks. ADAGE, thereby, contributes towards securely sharing valuable GNNs in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Not a...</summary><p>Not all authors have given their explicit consent</p></details> |

Recent graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks, but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs, preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier methods.</p></details> |  |

At its core, QGAT employs strongly entangling quantum circuits with amplitude-encoded node features to enable expressive nonlinear interactions. Distinct from classical multi-head attention that separately computes each head, QGAT leverages a single quantum circuit to simultaneously generate multiple attention coefficients. This quantum parallelism facilitates parameter sharing across heads, substantially reducing computational overhead and model complexity. Classical projection weights and quantum circuit parameters are optimized jointly in an end-to-end manner, ensuring flexible adaptation to learning tasks. Empirical results demonstrate QGAT's effectiveness in capturing complex structural dependencies and improved generalization in inductive scenarios, highlighting its potential for scalable quantum-enhanced learning across domains such as chemistry, biology, and network analysis. Furthermore, experiments confirm that quantum embedding enhances robustness against feature and structural noise, suggesting advantages in handling real-world noisy data. The modularity of QGAT also ensures straightforward integration into existing architectures, allowing it to easily augment classical attention-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[LASE: Learned Adjacency Spectral Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17734v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We put forth a principled design of a neural architecture to learn nodal Adjacency Spectral Embeddings (ASE) from graph inputs. By bringing to bear the gradient descent (GD) method and leveraging the principle of algorithm unrolling, we truncate and re-interpret each GD iteration as a layer in a graph neural network (GNN) that is trained to approximate the ASE. Accordingly, we call the resulting embeddings and our parametric model Learned ASE (LASE), which is interpretable, parameter efficient, robust to inputs with unobserved edges, and offers controllable complexity during inference. LASE layers combine Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and fully-connected Graph Attention Network (GAT) modules, which is intuitively pleasing since GCN-based local aggregations alone are insufficient to express the sought graph eigenvectors. We propose several refinements to the unrolled LASE architecture (such as sparse attention in the GAT module and decoupled layerwise parameters) that offer favorable approximation error versus computation tradeoffs; even outperforming heavily-optimized eigendecomposition routines from scientific computing libraries. Because LASE is a differentiable function with respect to its parameters as well as its graph input, we can seamlessly integrate it as a trainable module within a larger (semi-)supervised graph representation learning pipeline. The resulting end-to-end system effectively learns ``discriminative ASEs'' that exhibit competitive performance in supervised link prediction and node classification tasks, outperforming a GNN even when the latter is endowed with open loop, meaning task-agnostic, precomputed spectral positional encodings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Virtual Nodes for Alleviating Over-Squashing in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20597v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However, gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus, the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve performance on graph and node classification tasks.

Rethinking Evaluations for Graph-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20583v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning. These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce TRIGON, a novel framework that constructs enriched, non-planar triangulations by learning to select relevant triangles from multiple graph views. By jointly optimizing triangle selection and downstream classification performance, our method produces a rewired graph with markedly improved structural properties such as reduced diameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance compared to existing rewiring methods.

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR. However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263v7)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-rank tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) has recently achieved an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. In this work we, for the first time, obtain decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contractions with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023b), through this path matrices technique. Our method avoids the RREF algorithm and maintains a fully analytical derivation of each ICT decomposition matrix, thereby significantly improving the algorithm's speed to obtain arbitrary rank orthogonal ICT decomposition matrices and orthogonal equivariant bases. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on 28-core Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages.

However, mainstream approaches generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters and fixed aggregation rules, making it difficult to adapt to graph data with strong structural heterogeneity and complex feature distributions. This often leads to over-smoothing of node representations and semantic degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a parameter-free graph neural network framework based on structural diversity, namely SDGNN (Structural-Diversity Graph Neural Network). The framework is inspired by structural diversity theory and designs a unified structural-diversity message passing mechanism that simultaneously captures the heterogeneity of neighborhood structures and the stability of feature semantics, without introducing additional trainable parameters. Unlike traditional parameterized methods, SDGNN does not rely on complex model training, but instead leverages complementary modeling from both structure-driven and feature-driven perspectives, thereby effectively improving adaptability across datasets and scenarios. Experimental results show that on eight public benchmark datasets and an interdisciplinary PubMed citation network, SDGNN consistently outperforms mainstream GNNs under challenging conditions such as low supervision, class imbalance, and cross-domain transfer. This work provides a new theoretical perspective and general approach for the design of parameter-free graph neural networks, and further validates the importance of structural diversity as a core signal in graph representation learning. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, the full implementation of SDGNN has been released at: https://github.com/mingyue15694/SGDNN/tree/main</p></details> | 50 pages, 6 figures |

The majority of existing solutions towards link sign prediction mainly focus on unipartite signed graphs, which are sub-optimal due to the neglect of node heterogeneity and unique bipartite characteristics of SBGs. To this end, recent studies adapt graph neural networks to SBGs by introducing message-passing schemes for both inter-partition (UxV) and intra-partition (UxU or VxV) node pairs. However, the fundamental spectral convolutional operators were originally designed for positive links in unsigned graphs, and thus, are not optimal for inferring missing positive or negative links from known ones in SBGs. Motivated by this, this paper proposes GegenNet, a novel and effective spectral convolutional neural network model for link sign prediction in SBGs. In particular, GegenNet achieves enhanced model capacity and high predictive accuracy through three main technical contributions: (i) fast and theoretically grounded spectral decomposition techniques for node feature initialization; (ii) a new spectral graph filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomial basis; and (iii) multi-layer sign-aware spectral convolutional networks alternating Gegenbauer polynomial filters with positive and negative edges. Our extensive empirical studies reveal that GegenNet can achieve significantly superior performance (up to a gain of 4.28% in AUC and 11.69% in F1) in link sign prediction compared to 11 strong competitors over 6 benchmark SBG datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages.

From a perspective of graph signal processing, we find that graph Laplacian with a negative correction can derive graph frequencies beyond the conventional range $[0, 2]$. To explore whether the low-frequency information beyond this range can encode more informative properties about community structures, we propose InfraredGP. It (\romannumeral1) adopts a spectral GNN as its backbone combined with low-pass filters and a negative correction mechanism, (\romannumeral2) only feeds random inputs to this backbone, (\romannumeral3) derives graph embeddings via one feed-forward propagation (FFP) without any training, and (\romannumeral4) obtains feasible GP results by feeding the derived embeddings to BIRCH. Surprisingly, our experiments demonstrate that based solely on the negative correction mechanism that amplifies low-frequency information beyond $[0, 2]$, InfraredGP can derive distinguishable embeddings for some standard clustering modules (e.g., BIRCH) and obtain high-quality results for GP without any training. Following the IEEE HPEC Graph Challenge benchmark, we evaluate InfraredGP for both static and streaming GP, where InfraredGP can achieve much better efficiency (e.g., 16x-23x faster) and competitive quality over various baselines.

Existing supervised and weakly supervised solutions often rely on extensive annotated datasets and high-capacity models, making them computationally intensive and less adaptable to real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce a lightweight and unsupervised skeleton-based action localization pipeline that leverages spatio-temporal graph neural representations. Our approach pre-trains an Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ASTGCN) on a pose-sequence denoising task with blockwise partitions, enabling it to learn intrinsic motion dynamics without any manual labeling. At inference, we define a novel Action Dynamics Metric (ADM), computed directly from low-dimensional ASTGCN embeddings, which detects motion boundaries by identifying inflection points in its curvature profile. Our method achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.66% and average localization latency of 29.09 ms on the DSV Diving dataset, matching state-of-the-art supervised performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, it generalizes robustly to unseen, in-the-wild diving footage without retraining, demonstrating its practical applicability for lightweight, real-time action analysis systems in embedded or dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the ICIP Satellite Workshop 2025</p></details> |
| **[GIMS: Image Matching System Based on Adaptive Graph Construction and Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18221v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature-based image matching has extensive applications in computer vision. Keypoints detected in images can be naturally represented as graph structures, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to outperform traditional deep learning techniques. Consequently, the paradigm of image matching via GNNs has gained significant prominence in recent academic research. In this paper, we first introduce an innovative adaptive graph construction method that utilizes a filtering mechanism based on distance and dynamic threshold similarity. This method dynamically adjusts the criteria for incorporating new vertices based on the characteristics of existing vertices, allowing for the construction of more precise and robust graph structures while avoiding redundancy. We further combine the vertex processing capabilities of GNNs with the global awareness capabilities of Transformers to enhance the model's representation of spatial and feature information within graph structures. This hybrid model provides a deeper understanding of the interrelationships between vertices and their contributions to the matching process. Additionally, we employ the Sinkhorn algorithm to iteratively solve for optimal matching results. Finally, we validate our system using extensive image datasets and conduct comprehensive comparative experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves an average improvement of 3.8x-40.3x in overall matching performance. Additionally, the number of vertices and edges significantly impacts training efficiency and memory usage; therefore, we employ multi-GPU technology to accelerate the training process.

| **[Leveraging Multi-facet Paths for Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20648v4)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) and heterogeneous GNNs (HGNNs) have advanced node embeddings and relationship learning for various tasks. However, existing methods often rely on domain-specific predefined meta-paths, which are coarse-grained and focus solely on aspects like node type, limiting their ability to capture complex interactions. We introduce MF2Vec, a model that uses multi-faceted (fine-grained) paths instead of predefined meta-paths. MF2Vec extracts paths via random walks and generates multi-faceted vectors, ignoring predefined schemas. This method learns diverse aspects of nodes and their relationships, constructs a homogeneous network, and creates node embeddings for classification, link prediction, and clustering. Extensive experiments show that MF2Vec outperforms existing methods, offering a more flexible and comprehensive framework for analyzing complex networks. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MF2Vec-6ABC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Efficiency of Sampling-based Motion Planning via Message-Passing Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03909v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling-based motion planning methods, while effective in high-dimensional spaces, often suffer from inefficiencies due to irregular sampling distributions, leading to suboptimal exploration of the configuration space. In this paper, we propose an approach that enhances the efficiency of these methods by utilizing low-discrepancy distributions generated through Message-Passing Monte Carlo (MPMC). MPMC leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate point sets that uniformly cover the space, with uniformity assessed using the the $\cL_p$-discrepancy measure, which quantifies the irregularity of sample distributions. By improving the uniformity of the point sets, our approach significantly reduces computational overhead and the number of samples required for solving motion planning problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional sampling techniques in terms of planning efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting Multivariate Urban Data via Decomposition and Spatio-Temporal Graph Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22474v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term forecasting of multivariate urban data poses a significant challenge due to the complex spatiotemporal dependencies inherent in such datasets. This paper presents DST, a novel multivariate time-series forecasting model that integrates graph attention and temporal convolution within a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to effectively capture spatial and temporal dependencies, respectively. To enhance model performance, we apply a decomposition-based preprocessing step that isolates trend, seasonal, and residual components of the time series, enabling the learning of distinct graph structures for different time-series components. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets, including electricity demand, weather metrics, carbon intensity, and air pollution, demonstrate the effectiveness of DST across a range of forecast horizons, from several days to one month. Specifically, our approach achieves an average improvement of 2.89% to 9.10% in long-term forecasting accuracy over state-of-the-art time-series forecasting models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network-Based Topology Optimization for Self-Supporting Structures in Additive Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19169v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a machine learning-based framework for topology optimization of self-supporting structures, specifically tailored for additive manufacturing (AM). By employing a graph neural network (GNN) that acts as a neural field over the finite element mesh, the framework effectively learns and predicts continuous material distributions. An integrated AM filter ensures printability by eliminating unsupported overhangs, while the optimization process minimizes structural compliance under volume and stress constraints. The stress constraint is enforced using a differentiable p-norm aggregation of von Mises stress, promoting mechanical reliability in the optimized designs. A key advantage of the approach lies in its fully differentiable architecture, which leverages automatic differentiation throughout the optimization loop--eliminating the need for explicit sensitivity derivation for both the filter and the stress constraint. Numerical experiments demonstrate the ability of the framework to generate stress-constrained manufacturable topologies under various loading and boundary conditions, offering a practical pathway toward AM-ready high-performance designs with reduced post-processing requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCI-GRU: Stock Prediction Model Based on Multi-Head Cross-Attention and Improved GRU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20679v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As financial markets grow increasingly complex in the big data era, accurate stock prediction has become more critical. Traditional time series models, such as GRUs, have been widely used but often struggle to capture the intricate nonlinear dynamics of markets, particularly in the flexible selection and effective utilization of key historical information. Recently, methods like Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning have shown promise in stock prediction but require high data quality and quantity, and they tend to exhibit instability when dealing with data sparsity and noise. Moreover, the training and inference processes for these models are typically complex and computationally expensive, limiting their broad deployment in practical applications. Existing approaches also generally struggle to capture unobservable latent market states effectively, such as market sentiment and expectations, microstructural factors, and participant behavior patterns, leading to an inadequate understanding of market dynamics and subsequently impact prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a stock prediction model, MCI-GRU, based on a multi-head cross-attention mechanism and an improved GRU. First, we enhance the GRU model by replacing the reset gate with an attention mechanism, thereby increasing the model's flexibility in selecting and utilizing historical information. Second, we design a multi-head cross-attention mechanism for learning unobservable latent market state representations, which are further enriched through interactions with both temporal features and cross-sectional features. Finally, extensive experiments on four main stock markets show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA techniques across multiple metrics. Additionally, its successful application in real-world fund management operations confirms its effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated discovery of finite volume schemes using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19052v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have deeply modified the landscape of numerical simulations by demonstrating strong capabilities in approximating solutions of physical systems. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training domain (\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains uncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their traditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in conjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and theoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node graphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat equation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN achieves a loss $\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show that the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of the standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an unsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a residual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no access to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by considering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN using the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order correction term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the classic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm in scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be active contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[VISION: Robust and Interpretable Code Vulnerability Detection Leveraging Counterfactual Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18933v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner. However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset. Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to 97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20 vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization, Expressivity, and Universality of Graph Neural Networks on Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05464v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze the universality and generalization of graph neural networks (GNNs) on attributed graphs, i.e., with node attributes. To this end, we propose pseudometrics over the space of all attributed graphs that describe the fine-grained expressivity of GNNs. Namely, GNNs are both Lipschitz continuous with respect to our pseudometrics and can separate attributed graphs that are distant in the metric. Moreover, we prove that the space of all attributed graphs is relatively compact with respect to our metrics. Based on these properties, we prove a universal approximation theorem for GNNs and generalization bounds for GNNs on any data distribution of attributed graphs. The proposed metrics compute the similarity between the structures of attributed graphs via a hierarchical optimal transport between computation trees. Our work extends and unites previous approaches which either derived theory only for graphs with no attributes, derived compact metrics under which GNNs are continuous but without separation power, or derived metrics under which GNNs are continuous and separate points but the space of graphs is not relatively compact, which prevents universal approximation and generalization analysis.</p></details> |  |

Traditional computational approaches often struggle to capture the complex relationships among drugs, targets, and biological entities. In this work, we propose HGNN-DDI, a heterogeneous graph neural network model designed to predict potential DDIs by integrating multiple drug-related data sources. HGNN-DDI leverages graph representation learning to model heterogeneous biomedical networks, enabling effective information propagation across diverse node and edge types. Experimental results on benchmark DDI datasets demonstrate that HGNN-DDI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and robustness, highlighting its potential to support safer drug development and precision medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures.

Based on extensions of standard results in graphon analysis to graphon-signals, the paper proved a generalization bound and a sampling lemma for MPNNs. However, there are some missing ingredients in that paper, limiting its applicability in practical settings of graph machine learning. In the current paper, we introduce several refinements and extensions to existing results that address these shortcomings. In detail, 1) we extend the main results in the paper to graphon-signals with multidimensional signals (rather than 1D signals), 2) we extend the Lipschitz continuity to MPNNs with readout with respect to cut distance (rather than MPNNs without readout with respect to cut metric), 3) we improve the generalization bound by utilizing robustness-type generalization bounds, and 4) we extend the analysis to non-symmetric graphons and kernels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network Based Action Ranking for Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04752v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel approach to learn relational policies for classical planning based on learning to rank actions. We introduce a new graph representation that explicitly captures action information and propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture augmented with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to learn action rankings. Unlike value-function based approaches that must learn a globally consistent function, our action ranking method only needs to learn locally consistent ranking, which is more sample-efficient. Our model is trained on data generated from small problem instances that are easily solved by planners and is applied to significantly larger instances where planning is computationally prohibitive. Experimental results across standard planning benchmarks demonstrate that our action-ranking approach not only achieves better generalization to larger problems than those used in training but also outperforms multiple baseline (value function and action ranking) methods in terms of success rate and plan quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 1 figure.

| **[ParticleFormer: A 3D Point Cloud World Model for Multi-Object, Multi-Material Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23126v4)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D world models (i.e., learning-based 3D dynamics models) offer a promising approach to generalizable robotic manipulation by capturing the underlying physics of environment evolution conditioned on robot actions. However, existing 3D world models are primarily limited to single-material dynamics using a particle-based Graph Neural Network model, and often require time-consuming 3D scene reconstruction to obtain 3D particle tracks for training. In this work, we present ParticleFormer, a Transformer-based point cloud world model trained with a hybrid point cloud reconstruction loss, supervising both global and local dynamics features in multi-material, multi-object robot interactions. ParticleFormer captures fine-grained multi-object interactions between rigid, deformable, and flexible materials, trained directly from real-world robot perception data without an elaborate scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness both in 3D scene forecasting tasks, and in downstream manipulation tasks using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy. In addition, we extend existing dynamics learning benchmarks to include diverse multi-material, multi-object interaction scenarios. We validate our method on six simulation and three real-world experiments, where it consistently outperforms leading baselines by achieving superior dynamics prediction accuracy and less rollout error in downstream visuomotor tasks.

Preserving this equivalence, GNNs can universally approximate any target function on graphs in probability up to any precision. However, these results are limited to attributed discrete-dynamic graphs represented as sequences of connected graph snapshots. Real-world systems, such as communication networks, financial transaction networks, and molecular interactions, evolve asynchronously and may split into disconnected components. In this paper, we extend the theory of attributed discrete-dynamic graphs to attributed continuous-time dynamic graphs with arbitrary connectivity. To this end, we introduce a continuous-time dynamic 1-WL test, prove its equivalence to continuous-time dynamic unfolding trees, and identify a class of continuous-time dynamic GNNs (CGNNs) based on discrete-dynamic GNN architectures that retain both distinguishing power and universal approximation guarantees. Our constructive proofs further yield practical design guidelines, emphasizing a compact and expressive CGNN architecture with piece-wise continuously differentiable temporal functions to process asynchronous, disconnected graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training Transformers for Mesh-Based Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18051v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating physics using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is predominantly driven by message-passing architectures, which face challenges in scaling and efficiency, particularly in handling large, complex meshes. These architectures have inspired numerous enhancements, including multigrid approaches and $K$-hop aggregation (using neighbours of distance $K$), yet they often introduce significant complexity and suffer from limited in-depth investigations. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel Graph Transformer architecture that leverages the adjacency matrix as an attention mask. The proposed approach incorporates innovative augmentations, including Dilated Sliding Windows and Global Attention, to extend receptive fields without sacrificing computational efficiency. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate model size, adjacency matrix augmentations, positional encoding and $K$-hop configurations using challenging 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. We also train over 60 models to find a scaling law between training FLOPs and parameters. The introduced models demonstrate remarkable scalability, performing on meshes with up to 300k nodes and 3 million edges. Notably, the smallest model achieves parity with MeshGraphNet while being $7\times$ faster and $6\times$ smaller. The largest model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by $38.8$\% on average and outperforms MeshGraphNet by $52$\% on the all-rollout RMSE, while having a similar training speed.

However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has been less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF is a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To improve the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework, LLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for MAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained graph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the first work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs with the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior performance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing LLM-based approaches in solving MAPF problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

However, existing spiking GNNs predominantly operate in Euclidean space and rely on fixed geometric assumptions, limiting their capacity to model complex graph structures such as hierarchies and cycles. To overcome these limitations, we propose \method{}, a novel Geometry-Aware Spiking Graph Neural Network that unifies spike-based neural dynamics with adaptive representation learning on Riemannian manifolds. \method{} features three key components: a Riemannian Embedding Layer that projects node features into a pool of constant-curvature manifolds, capturing non-Euclidean structures; a Manifold Spiking Layer that models membrane potential evolution and spiking behavior in curved spaces via geometry-consistent neighbor aggregation and curvature-based attention; and a Manifold Learning Objective that enables instance-wise geometry adaptation through jointly optimized classification and link prediction losses defined over geodesic distances. All modules are trained using Riemannian SGD, eliminating the need for backpropagation through time. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that GSG achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and energy efficiency compared to both Euclidean SNNs and manifold-based GNNs, establishing a new paradigm for curvature-aware, energy-efficient graph learning.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose S$^2$G-Net, a novel neural architecture that unifies state-space sequence modeling with multi-view Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for ICU LOS prediction. The temporal path employs Mamba state-space models (SSMs) to capture patient trajectories, while the graph path leverages an optimized GraphGPS backbone, designed to integrate heterogeneous patient similarity graphs derived from diagnostic, administrative, and semantic features. Experiments on the large-scale MIMIC-IV cohort dataset show that S$^2$G-Net consistently outperforms sequence models (BiLSTM, Mamba, Transformer), graph models (classic GNNs, GraphGPS), and hybrid approaches across all primary metrics. Extensive ablation studies and interpretability analyses highlight the complementary contributions of each component of our architecture and underscore the importance of principled graph construction. These results demonstrate that S$^2$G-Net provides an effective and scalable solution for ICU LOS prediction with multi-modal clinical data.</p></details> |  |
